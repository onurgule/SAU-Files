<hr>

This lecture is a continuation of computer organization &amp; stack frames.  
The focus is on procedure calls.  <p>

Look at the following C code
(<b><a href="http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~jplank/plank/classes/cs360/360/notes/Assembler2/p1.c">p1.c</a></b>):

</p><p></p><center><table border="3" cellpadding="3"><tbody><tr><td><pre>int a()
{
  return 1;
}

int main()
{
  int i;

  i = a();
}
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></center><p>

This compiles into assembler that looks like the following:

</p><pre>    a:
	mov #1 -&gt; %r0
	ret
    main:
	push #4
	jsr a
	st %r0 -&gt; [fp]
	ret
</pre>

Both of these procedure calls are straightforward.  <b>Main()</b> first allocates
one variable on the stack, and then calls "<b>jsr a</b>", which means
jump to subroutine <b>a</b>.  All <b>a()</b> does is return 1 to its caller -- it does that
by setting <b>r0</b> to one, and then calling <b>"ret"</b>.
When control returns to <b>main()</b> it stores <b>a's</b> return value, which is in <b>r0</b>,
to the memory that it has allocated for <b>i</b>.  And it returns.
<p>

This seems simple; however, what goes on when <b>jsr</b> and <b>ret</b> are
called is a little trickier.  This is what happens:</p><p>

When "<b>jsr</b>" is called, <b>(pc+4)</b> and the current value of
<b>fp</b> are both pushed onto the stack.  Because of the pushing, 
the <b>sp</b>'s value will be 8
less than it was before the <b>jsr</b> call.  Then, the <b>fp</b>
is changed to be the current <b>sp</b>, and <b>pc</b> is changed to be
the location of the first instruction of the named procedure.  This
is done atomically by the computer's hardware.  After <b>jsr</b> has
taken effect, we are in a new stack frame, and the <b>pc</b> is
executing <b>a()</b>.</p><p>

When "<b>ret</b>" is called, the <b>sp</b> is changed to be the current
<b>fp</b>.  Then the <b>fp</b> is popped off the stack: The <b>sp</b>'s value
is incremented by four, and the <b>fp</b> is read from the stack.
Finally,
the <b>pc</b> is popped off the stack: The <b>sp</b>'s value
is incremented by four again, and the <b>pc</b> is read from the stack.
Like "<b>jsr</b>",
this is all done atomically by the hardware.  When "<b>ret</b>"
completes, the <b>pc</b> is set to be the instruction after the
original "<b>jsr</b>" instruction, and the stack frame of that procedure has been
restored.</p><p>

Let's look at it pictorally.  Below is a drawing of what you'll see if you run 
<b>jassem.tcl</b> on <b>p1.jas</b>.  At the start of the program, the stack and registers
look as follows:</p><p> 


</p><p></p><center><table border="3"><tbody><tr><td><img src="./CS360 Lecture notes -- Assembler Lecture #2_ Procedures, Stack Frames, Spilling_files/p1-1008.jpg" width="600"></td></tr></tbody></table></center><p>

(As an aside -- <b>jassem.tcl</b> assigns zero to unknown values and registers.  Here,
I'm putting "unknown" to show that we don't know what the values will really be.)
</p><p>
First, the <b>sp</b> is decremented by 4 to allocate the local variable <b>i</b>:

</p><p></p><center><table border="3"><tbody><tr><td><img src="./CS360 Lecture notes -- Assembler Lecture #2_ Procedures, Stack Frames, Spilling_files/p1-100c.jpg" width="600"></td></tr></tbody></table></center><p>

Now <b>jsr</b> is called.  This pushes <b>(pc+4)</b> and the
value of the <b>fp</b> on the stack, and sets the <b>fp</b> to
the new <b>sp</b>, and <b>pc</b> to <b>a</b>: 

</p><p></p><center><table border="3"><tbody><tr><td><img src="./CS360 Lecture notes -- Assembler Lecture #2_ Procedures, Stack Frames, Spilling_files/p1-1000.jpg" width="600"></td></tr></tbody></table></center><p>

Note now that we have a new stack frame for <b>a</b>, 
and the <b>pc</b> is executing <b>a</b>.
The first thing it does is load <b>1</b> into <b>r0</b>:

</p><p></p><center><table border="3"><tbody><tr><td><img src="./CS360 Lecture notes -- Assembler Lecture #2_ Procedures, Stack Frames, Spilling_files/p1-1004.jpg" width="600"></td></tr></tbody></table></center><p>

We then call "<b>ret</b>".  "<b>Ret</b>" sets the <b>sp</b> to the <b>fp</b>
(which involves nothing in this case), and then
pops the <b>fp</b> and the <b>pc</b> off the stack.  When it's
done we're back to <b>main()</b>'s stack frame, and
executing the next instruction after the <b>jsr</b>: 

</p><p></p><center><table border="3"><tbody><tr><td><img src="./CS360 Lecture notes -- Assembler Lecture #2_ Procedures, Stack Frames, Spilling_files/p1-1010.jpg" width="600"></td></tr></tbody></table></center><p>

Note the "fp in main" and "pc in main" values don't get changed or erased.  They simply
remain on the stack. However since they are
"above the stack", they should not get referenced.
Now the "<b>st %r0 -&gt; [fp]</b>" gets executed, and the machine state looks like:

</p><p></p><center><table border="3"><tbody><tr><td><img src="./CS360 Lecture notes -- Assembler Lecture #2_ Procedures, Stack Frames, Spilling_files/p1-1014.jpg" width="600"></td></tr></tbody></table></center><p>

Now <b>main()</b> is over, and calls "<b>ret</b>".  You can imagine
what this does -- the stack is set up so that when <b>main()</b> calls
<b>ret</b>, control returns to the operating system and the process
goes away.  

</p><p>
Now, make sure you go over this with <b>Jassem</b>.  The program is
in <a href="http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~jplank/plank/classes/cs360/360/notes/Assembler2/p1.jas"><b>p1.jas</b></a>, and you should see exactly what
I have shown above.

</p><hr>

The next example shows a procedure with arguments and local variables.
It's a pretty meaty example.  The C code 
(<b><a href="http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~jplank/plank/classes/cs360/360/notes/Assembler2/p2.c">p2.c</a></b>):
is to the left, and the assembler
(<b><a href="http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~jplank/plank/classes/cs360/360/notes/Assembler2/p2.jas">p2.jas</a></b>):
is to the right:

<p></p><center><table border="3" cellpadding="3"><tbody><tr><td valign="top"><pre>int a(int i, int j)
{
  int k;

  i++;
  j -= 2;
  k = i * j;
  return k;
}

int main()
{
  int i, j, k;

  i = 3;
  j = 4;
  k = a(j+1, i);
  return 0;
}
</pre></td>
<td valign="top"><pre>a:
    push #4                 <font color="blue">/ Allocate k, which will be [fp]</font>
    
    ld [fp+12] -&gt; %r0       <font color="blue">/ i++</font>
    add %r0, %g1 -&gt; %r0
    st %r0 -&gt; [fp+12]

    ld [fp+16] -&gt; %r0       <font color="blue">/ j -= 2</font>
    mov #2 -&gt; %r1
    sub %r0, %r1 -&gt; %r0

    ld [fp+12] -&gt; %r0       <font color="blue">/ k = i * j</font>
    ld [fp+16] -&gt; %r1
    mul %r0, %r1 -&gt; %r0
    st %r0 -&gt; [fp]

    ld [fp] -&gt; %r0          <font color="blue">/ return k</font>
    ret

main:
    push #12                <font color="blue">/ Allocate i, j, k.  </font>
                            <font color="blue">/ i is [fp-8], j is [fp-4], k is [fp]</font>

    mov #3 -&gt; %r0           <font color="blue">/ i = 3</font>
    st %r0 -&gt; [fp-8] 
    mov #4 -&gt; %r0           <font color="blue">/ j = 4</font>
    st %r0 -&gt; [fp-4]

    ld [fp-8] -&gt; %r0        <font color="blue">/ Push i onto the stack</font>
    st %r0 -&gt; [sp]--

    ld [fp-4] -&gt; %r0        <font color="blue">/ Push j+1 onto the stack</font>
    add %r0, %g1 -&gt; %r0
    st %r0 -&gt; [sp]--

    jsr a                   <font color="blue">/ Call a(), then pop the arguments </font>
    pop #8  

    st %r0 -&gt; [fp]         <font color="blue">/ Put the return value into k</font>
    
    mov #0 -&gt; %r0          <font color="blue">/ Return 0</font>
    ret
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></center><p>

Let's focus first on the <b>main()</b>.  In the beginning, it decrements the
stack pointer by 12, which allocates, 
<b>i</b>,
<b>j</b> and
<b>k</b> on the stack.  Our compiler puts them in the order in which they are declared
on the stack, so as the comments above state: 
<b>i</b> is at <b>[fp-8]</b>, 
<b>j</b> is at <b>[fp-4]</b> and
<b>k</b> is at <b>[fp]</b>.  Next, we initialize <b>i</b> and <b>j</b>.  That is straightforward.

</p><p>
The procedure call requires explanation.  When you call a procedure with arguments, what you
do is <i>push the arguments onto the stack in reverse order</i>.  Then you call <b>jsr</b>.
When the <b>jsr</b> call returns, you pop the arguments off the stack, so that you can 
reuse that memory.  
</p><p>
In this case, let's take a look at the stack when <b>main()</b> calls <b>jsr</b>.  I'm going
to draw this myself, but the values and addresses match up with what happens when you run 
this in <b>jassem</b>:

</p><p></p><center><table border="3"><tbody><tr><td><img src="./CS360 Lecture notes -- Assembler Lecture #2_ Procedures, Stack Frames, Spilling_files/p2-jsr.jpg" width="600"></td></tr></tbody></table></center><p>

It's good practice to label the stack -- you should be able to account for every word.
</p><p>
Now, the <b>jsr</b> statement pushes <b>(pc+4)</b> onto the stack, and then the value
of the <b>fp</b>.  It then sets the <b>pc</b> to the first instruction in <b>a</b>.  That
instruction is <b>push #4</b>, so that it allocates <b>k</b>.  At this point, here are
the labeled stack values and registers.  You'll note, I've relabeled the two arguments
that were pushed onto the stack as "<b>i</b> in <b>a()</b>" and 
"<b>j</b> in <b>a()</b>":

</p><p></p><center><table border="3"><tbody><tr><td><img src="./CS360 Lecture notes -- Assembler Lecture #2_ Procedures, Stack Frames, Spilling_files/p2-ld.jpg" width="600"></td></tr></tbody></table></center><p>
</p><p>
Now, let's consider how <b>a()</b> finds its two arguments.  It knows that the old
<b>fp</b> is in <b>[fp+4]</b> and the old <b>pc</b> is in <b>[fp+8]</b>.  
Since the arguments are pushed in reverse order, the first argument should be next,
at <b>[fp+12]</b>.  The second argument is at <b>[fp+16]</b>.  If there were a third
argument, it would be at <b>[fp+20]</b>, and so on.  
</p><p>
Now, let's look at the state when <b>a()</b> returns.  At that point, you should see
that <b>a()'s</b> variables 
<b>i</b>, 
<b>j</b> and
<b>k</b> are equal to 6, 1 and 6 respectively.  <b>k</b>'s value has been loaded into the
register <b>r0</b>, as that is how return values are passed from one procedure to another:

</p><p></p><center><table border="3"><tbody><tr><td><img src="./CS360 Lecture notes -- Assembler Lecture #2_ Procedures, Stack Frames, Spilling_files/p2-a-ret.jpg" width="600"></td></tr></tbody></table></center><p>

Finally, when the <b>pc</b> is set to <tt>0x1064</tt> and the <b>fp</b> is set back to 
<tt>0xfff448</tt>, we are back in <b>main()</b>.  The stack pointer is popped eight bytes,
and the return value is stored into <b>k</b>.  When <b>main()</b> returns, the system looks
as follows:
</p><p></p><center><table border="3"><tbody><tr><td><img src="./CS360 Lecture notes -- Assembler Lecture #2_ Procedures, Stack Frames, Spilling_files/p2-main-ret.jpg" width="600"></td></tr></tbody></table></center><p>

Let's go over all of the main points from this example (including some review):

</p><ul>
<li> The <b>jsr</b> statement does four things: It pushes <b>(pc+4)</b> onto the stack, then <b>fp</b>, then it sets the <b>fp</b> to the current value of the <b>sp</b>, and the <b>pc</b> to the first instruction of the given procedure.
<p>
</p></li><li> The <b>ret</b> statement undoes what <b>jsr</b> has set up: It sets the <b>sp</b> to the
current value of the <b>fp</b>, then it pops the <b>fp</b> and the <b>pc</b> off of the stack.
<p>
</p></li><li> If a procedure has arguments, you need to push them onto the stack in reverse order, before
making the <b>jsr</b> call.
<p>
</p></li><li> Thus, when a procedure is called, its first argument is at <b>[fp+12]</b>.  
Its second argument is at <b>[fp+16]</b>.  
Its third argument is at <b>[fp+20]</b>.   And so on.
<p>
</p></li><li> When a procedure returns a value to its caller, it stores the value in <b>r0</b>.
<p>
</p></li><li> If you have pushed arguments before calling <b>jsr</b>, then the very first thing that
you should do when the <b>jsr</b> call returns is pop those arguments off the stack.
<p>
</p></li><li> Although you are not currently using values whose addresses are less than or equal to
the stack pointer, those addresses will have values, and those values may be deterministic.
For example, in that last picture, there are a lot of values above the stack pointer, and
we know what all of them are between <tt>0xfff42c</tt> and <tt>0xfff43c</tt>, because we know
what the previous instructions have done.
<p>
</p></li><li> You should be able to see how each procedure gets its own memory locations for its parameters
and local variables.  Even though <b>main()</b> and <b>a()</b> each used 
<b>i</b>, <b>j</b> and <b>k</b>, they had their own separate memory locations for them.
<p>
</p></li><li> You should also see how memory gets allocated for local variables and parameters when a 
procedure executes, and how it goes away when the procedure is done.
</li></ul>

<p>
As always, I advocate running <b>jassem.tcl</b> on this program yourself and making sure you
understand what's going on.
</p><p>

<h2>Register Spilling</h2>

One important thing that has to
be decided is whether a procedure may use a
register without worrying about its current value
(like <b>a()</b> does with <b>r0</b>), or whether a procedure
should first save the register on the stack
before using it.  This matters, because suppose
for example, that the main routine uses register
<b>r3</b>, then calls "<b>jsr a</b>", and afterwards expects <b>r3</b>
to have the same value.  Then <b>a()</b> and any
procedures that <b>a()</b> calls must make sure not to
use <b>r3</b>, or to save <b>r3</b>'s value before using it,
and restore it when its done.  
<p>
The act of saving a register's value before the body of a procedure
call and restoring it afterwards is called <i>spilling</i>.
Different machines and compilers handle spilling in different ways.  For
example, older CISC architectures sometimes had a spill-mask that 
would be part of a procedure call.  This specified which registers should
be spilled, and the machine actually did the spilling for you.
</p><p>
What we do on our machine is a typical spilling solution:
Procedures can use <b>r0</b> and <b>r1</b> without worrying
about their values.  However, registers <b>r2</b> through 
<b>r4</b> must be spilled if a procedure uses them.
</p><p>
Here's an example
(<b><a href="http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~jplank/plank/classes/cs360/360/notes/Assembler2/spill1.c">spill1.c</a></b>):

</p><p></p><center><table border="3" cellpadding="3"><tbody><tr><td><pre>int a(int i, int j)
{
  int k;

  k = (i+2)*(j-5);
  return k;
}

int main()
{
  int i;

  i = a(44, 22);
}
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></center><p>

To compile arithmetic expressions into assembler, it's useful to turn them
into trees.  For example, the above expression becomes:

</p><p></p><center><table border="3"><tbody><tr><td><img src="./CS360 Lecture notes -- Assembler Lecture #2_ Procedures, Stack Frames, Spilling_files/Spill-1.jpg"></td></tr></tbody></table></center><p>

In order to evaluate the tree, you need to do a 
<a href="http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~jplank/plank/classes/cs140/Notes/Trees/index.html">
postorder traversal</a> (or, 
if you think of the edges are pointing upward, you need to do a <a href="http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~jplank/plank/classes/cs302/Notes/Topological/">topological sorting</a> of the tree).  
Arithmetic has to be done on a register-by-register basis, so each of those nodes
must be in a register. You (the compiler) must figure out an ordering of instructions
that is legal, and then an assignment of nodes to registers so that you don't reuse
registers unless you can be sure that you don't need their values any more.  
</p><p>For 
example, in the above expression, suppose you do the (i+2) calculation first and 
hold the result in <b>r0</b>.  Then you can't use <b>r0</b> to calculate (j-5). 
For that reason, you are going to have to use <b>r2</b>, and because you are using
<b>r2</b>, you'll have to spill it onto the stack.  I do this at the beginning of
a procedure.  Then at the end, I "unspill" it by reading it back from the stack.
</p><p>
The code is in 
<b><a href="http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~jplank/plank/classes/cs360/360/notes/Assembler2/spill1.jas">spill1.jas</a></b>, which I've reproduced below.  You 
may use <b>jassem.tcl</b> to step through this.

</p><p></p><center><table border="3" cellpadding="3"><tbody><tr><td><pre>a:

    ld [fp] -&gt; %r0
    ld ++[sp] -&gt; %r2     <font color="blue">/ Unspill r2</font>
    ret

    push #4              <font color="blue">/ Allocate i</font>
 
    mov #22 -&gt; %r0       <font color="blue">/ Push arguments onto the stack in reverse order</font>
    st %r0 -&gt; [sp]--
    mov #44 -&gt; %r0       
    st %r0 -&gt; [sp]--
    jsr a
    pop #8               <font color="blue">/ Always pop the arguments off the stack after jsr</font>

    st %r0 -&gt; [fp]
    ret
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></center><p>

Note, that you have to spill <b>r2</b> onto the stack <i>after</i> allocating
the local variable.   Otherwise, <b>k</b> will not be at <b>[fp]</b>.  Think
about it.
    
</p><hr>
<h2>An example to show why spilling matters</h2>

Take a look at
<b><a href="http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~jplank/plank/classes/cs360/360/notes/Assembler2/spill2.c">spill2.c</a></b>:

<p></p><center><table border="3" cellpadding="3"><tbody><tr><td><pre>int a(int i, int j)
{
  int k;

  k = (i+2)*(j-5);
  return k;
}

int main()
{
  int i;

  i = (a(10, 20) + a(30, 40));
}
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></center><p>

You'll note that <b>a()</b> is exactly the same.  The only difference is that
we're calling <b>a()</b> twice, and adding up the return values.  Think about
that for a minute -- where should you store the return value of the first 
call to <b>a()</b>?  You can't store it in <b>r0</b> or <b>r1</b> because 
making a procedure call will destroy them (we have to assume that).
Therefore, you have to store it in a higher register, like <b>r2</b>.
You know that's ok, because <b>a()</b> will make sure that <b>r2</b>'s value is 
unchanged.  Here's the code for <b>main()</b> (in
<b><a href="http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~jplank/plank/classes/cs360/360/notes/Assembler2/spill2.jas">spill2.jas</a></b>).  You'll notice that <b>main()</b> spills
<b>r2</b> as well, because if any procedure uses
<b>r2</b>, <b>r3</b> or <b>r4</b>, it must spill them.

</p><p></p><center><table border="3" cellpadding="3"><tbody><tr><td><pre>main:

    push #4              <font color="blue">/ Allocate i</font>
    st %r2 -&gt; [sp]--     <font color="blue">/ Spill r2</font>
 
    mov #20 -&gt; %r0       <font color="blue">/ Call a(10, 20) and store the result in r2</font>
    st %r0 -&gt; [sp]--
    mov #10 -&gt; %r0
    st %r0 -&gt; [sp]--
    jsr a
    pop #8
    mov %r0 -&gt; %r2       

    mov #40 -&gt; %r0       <font color="blue">/ Call a(30, 40) and add the result to r2</font>
    st %r0 -&gt; [sp]--
    mov #30 -&gt; %r0
    st %r0 -&gt; [sp]--
    jsr a

    add %r0, %r2 -&gt; %r0
    st %r0 -&gt; [fp]
   
    ld ++[sp] -&gt; %r2     <font color="blue">/ Unspill r2</font>
    ret
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></center><p>

Once again, I urge you to trace through this code with <b>jassem</b> to see
how the spilling works.
</p><hr>
<h2>What do you do when you run out of registers?</h2>

Try 
<b><a href="http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~jplank/plank/classes/cs360/360/notes/Assembler2/spill3.c">spill3.c</a></b> on for size:

<p></p><center><table border="3" cellpadding="3"><tbody><tr><td><pre>int a(int i)
{
  return i+5;
}

int main()
{
  int i;

  i = ( (a(2)+a(3)) * (a(4)+a(5)) + (a(10)+a(11)) * (a(12)+a(13)) ) *
      ( (a(6)+a(7)) * (a(8)+a(9)) + (a(14)+a(15)) * (a(16)+a(17)) );
}
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></center><p>
Yuck.  Here's the expression tree:

</p><p></p><center><table border="3"><tbody><tr><td><img src="./CS360 Lecture notes -- Assembler Lecture #2_ Procedures, Stack Frames, Spilling_files/Spill-3.jpg"></td></tr></tbody></table></center><p>

You can see I've labeled it with the registers that you can use if you do the 
calculation in post-order, from left to right.   You'll see that we've run
out of registers!
</p><p>
Below, I show how you handle that -- you spill the intermediate value shown 
as "Spill". That allows you to use <b>r2</b> again, and you no longer run out
of registers.  Before you do the last multiplication, you unspill the value into
a register:

Did you really want to see the assembler for that?  It's in 
<b><a href="http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~jplank/plank/classes/cs360/360/notes/Assembler2/spill3.jas">spill3.jas</a></b>.  It's not that hard to read.  Here's
the crucial code: Spilling the result of the sum (by the "Spill" in the picture
above) onto the stack.  I start with the call to <b>a(13)</b>.  When it's done,
you perform the multiplication and addition, and then spill the result of the
addition onto the stack.  Then you start working on the right side of the equation
(starting with <b>a(6)</b>):

</p><p></p><center><table border="3" cellpadding="3"><tbody><tr><td><pre>    ...
    mov #13 -&gt; %r0
    st %r0 -&gt; [sp]--
    jsr a
    pop #4
    add %r0, %r4 -&gt; %r0

    mul %r3, %r0 -&gt; %r0   <font color="blue">/ Multiplication, then Addition, then spill</font>
    add %r2, %r0 -&gt; %r0   
    st %r0 -&gt; [sp]--

    mov #6 -&gt; %r0          <font color="blue">/ a(6)+a(7)</font>
    st %r0 -&gt; [sp]--
    jsr a
    pop #4
    mov %r0 -&gt; %r2
    ...
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></center><p>

At the end, when you're done with <b>a(17)</b>, you do the multiplication
and addition.  You have one more multiplication, but its operand is the
one spilled to the stack.  You unspill it and perform the multiplication.
Then you're done!

</p><p></p><center><table border="3" cellpadding="3"><tbody><tr><td><pre>    ...
    mov #17 -&gt; %r0
    st %r0 -&gt; [sp]--
    jsr a
    pop #4
    add %r0, %r4 -&gt; %r0

    mul %r3, %r0 -&gt; %r0   <font color="blue">/ Multiplication, then addition, then unspill and multiply</font>
    add %r2, %r0 -&gt; %r0   
    ld ++[sp] -&gt; %r1
    mul %r0, %r1 -&gt; %r0

    st %r0 -&gt; [fp]        <font color="blue">/ Store the result into i</font>

    ld ++[sp] -&gt; %r4      <font color="blue">/ Unspill before returning</font>
    ld ++[sp] -&gt; %r3
    ld ++[sp] -&gt; %r2
    ret
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></center><p>

You can run <b>jassem</b> on this -- it's a bit cumbersome, but I have important
screen shots.  Here is the state just before the crucial spill:

</p><p></p><center><table border="3"><tbody><tr><td><img src="./CS360 Lecture notes -- Assembler Lecture #2_ Procedures, Stack Frames, Spilling_files/Spill-3-SS-1.jpg"></td></tr></tbody></table></center><p>

You can double-check yourself -- <b>a(i)</b> simply adds 5 to <b>i</b>, so:

</p><ul>
<li> <b>r4</b> should equal (12+5) = 17 = 0x11.  
</li><li> <b>r3</b> should equal (10+5+11+5) = 31 = 0x1f.  
</li><li> <b>r2</b> should equal (2+5+3+5)*(4+5+5+5) = 15*19 = 285 = 0x11d
</li></ul>

After the spill, 0x55a goes onto the stack:

<p></p><center><table border="3"><tbody><tr><td><img src="./CS360 Lecture notes -- Assembler Lecture #2_ Procedures, Stack Frames, Spilling_files/Spill-3-SS-2.jpg"></td></tr></tbody></table></center><p>

I continue stepping to the "unspill":

</p><p></p><center><table border="3"><tbody><tr><td><img src="./CS360 Lecture notes -- Assembler Lecture #2_ Procedures, Stack Frames, Spilling_files/Spill-3-SS-3.jpg"></td></tr></tbody></table></center><p>

And at the end, <b>i</b> has been set to 0x3009e4 = 3148620.  Is that right?
I'll let you double-check it yourself, but it is indeed correct!
