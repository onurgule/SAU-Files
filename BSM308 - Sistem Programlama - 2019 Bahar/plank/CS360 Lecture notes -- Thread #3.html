In this lecture, we go over race conditions in more detail, focusing
on using mutexes, and the trade-off between safety and performance.

<h2>SSNSERVER</h2>

The lecture revolves around a piece of code that maintains a 
database of people/ages/social security numbers.  The main
code is in <a href="http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~jplank/plank/classes/cs360/360/notes/Thread3/ssnserver.c"><b>ssnserver.c</b></a>.
It maintains a red-black tree (<i>t</i>) keyed on a person's
name (in the order <i>last, first</i>).  The <i>val</i> field
points to an <b>Entry</b> struct, which contains the person's
name again, his/her age, and his/her social-security number,
stored as a string.  
<p>
<b>Ssnserver.c</b> creates the tree and then accepts four
kinds of inputs from standard input:
</p><ol>
<li> <b>ADD <i>fn ln age ssn</i></b> -- This adds an entry to the tree. 
</li><li> <b>DELETE <i>fn ln</i></b> -- This deletes an entry from the tree.
</li><li> <b>PRINT</b> -- This prints the tree.
</li><li> <b>DONE</b> -- This causes the program to exit.
</li></ol>

<h2>INPUTGEN</h2>

Ok, now look at <a href="http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~jplank/plank/classes/cs360/360/notes/Thread3/inputgen.c"><b>inputgen.c</b></a>.
This is a program that I wrote to really beat on <b>ssnserver</b>.
As input, it takes a number of events, a random number seed, and
a file of last names.  The file of last names that I've created
is <a href="http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~jplank/plank/classes/cs360/360/notes/Thread3/lns"><b>lns</b></a>, which is simply 
a dictionary of words copied into a
file.   The program reads the last names
into the array <b>lns</b>, and it has an array <b>fns</b> of 
65 first names.  Now, what it does is create <b>nevents</b> 
random input events for <b>ssnserver.c</b>.  The first 50
events are random <b>ADD</b> events, and thereafter, it
will create either <b>ADD</b>, <b>DELETE</b> or <b>PRINT</b>
events (these in the ratio 5/5/1).   It ends with a <b>PRINT</b>
and a <b>DONE</b> event.

<p>
In order to create <b>DELETE</b>
events that correspond to entries in the tree, <b>inputgen</b>
uses a rb-tree of its own.  This tree is keyed on a random number,
and its val field is one of the names that it added previously.
When it creates a <b>DELETE</b> event, it chooses the first name
in the tree -- this will be a random name, deletes it from the
tree, and then uses this name for the <b>DELETE</b> event.
</p><p>

So, this is a little complex, but you should be able to understand
it.  <b>Inputgen</b> is set up so that the tree that it manages
will average around 50 elements, regardless of the number of
events that it generates.  To prove this to yourself,
try it:

<h2>Turning ssnserver into a real server</h2>

Now, look at <a href="http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~jplank/plank/classes/cs360/360/notes/Thread3/ssnserver1.c"><b>ssnserver1.c</b></a>.
<p>
What this does is turn <b>ssnserver</b> into a real server.
It serves a socket, and then calls <b>accept_connection()</b>, 
and creates a <b>server_thread()</b> thread to service the
connection.
The <b>server_thread()</b> thread works just like
<b>ssnserver.c</b>, with the exception that the tree is a global
variable.
</p><p>
Try it out with <b>telnet</b>.  For example, in one window
on <b>hydra4</b> I do:
</p><ul><pre>UNIX&gt; <font color="darkred"><b>./ssnserver1 8888</b></font>
</pre></ul>
while in another, I do:
<ul><pre>UNIX&gt; <font color="darkred"><b>nc hydra4 8888</b></font>
<b><font color="darkred">ADD Jim Plank 31 123-45-6789
ADD Phil Fulmer 45 987-65-4321
PRINT</font></b>
__________________________________________________
Fulmer, Phil                   -- 987-65-4321   45
Plank, Jim                     -- 123-45-6789   31
--------------------------------------------------
<b><font color="darkred">DONE</font></b>

                               <font color="blue">It is unfortunate that nc doesn't figure out that the </font>
Ncat: Broken pipe.             <font color="blue">connection is gone until it catches SIGPIPE.</font>
UNIX&gt; 
</pre></ul>

It works just fine.  I modified <b>inputgen.c</b> to work as a
socket client -- the code is in 
<a href="http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~jplank/plank/classes/cs360/360/notes/Thread3/inclient.c"><b>inclient.c</b></a>.
It is straightforward and uses a second thread to read the 
socket output and print it to standard out.  Try it out on
the same server:
<ul><pre>UNIX&gt; <font color="darkred"><b>./inclient hydra4 8888 5 1 lns</b></font>

UNIX&gt;
</pre></ul>

Now, look at <a href="http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~jplank/plank/classes/cs360/360/notes/Thread3/ssnserver2.c"><b>ssnserver2.c</b></a>.
This works just like <b>ssnserver1</b> except that it can
service multiple connections simultaneously by forking
off one <b>server_thread()</b> per connection.  Note however,
that that access to <b>t</b> is not protected by mutexes.
This presents a problem because, for example, one thread may
be adding one element to the tree while another is deleting
a nearby element.  If the first thread is interrupted before
it finishes adding the element, then the rb-tree pointers may
not be where they should be when the second thread tries to
delete.  This will result in an error, probably a core dump.
<p>
To help illustrate this, I wrote a shell script called 
<a href="http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~jplank/plank/classes/cs360/360/notes/Thread3/kill_it.sh"><b>kill_it.sh</b></a>.  This forks
off a given number of <b>inclient</b> processes who all 
blast away at the given <b>ssnserver2</b> server.
</p><p>
Try it out:  On one machine, start a <b>ssnserver2</b>.
For example, I did the following on <b>hydra4</b>:

</p><ul><pre>UNIX&gt; <font color="darkred"><b>./ssnserver2 hydra4.eecs.utk.edu 8888</b></font>
</pre></ul>

Then, on <b>hydra3</b>, I had 5 <b>inclients</b> send 1000
entries simultaneously to the server:

<ul><pre>UNIX&gt; <font color="darkred"><b>sh kill_it.sh</b></font>
usage: sh kill_it.sh host port nentries nclients
UNIX&gt; <font color="darkred"><b>sh kill_it.sh hydra4 8888 10000 5 &gt; &amp; /dev/null</b></font>
</pre></ul>

Within a few seconds, the <b>ssnserver2</b> process had a segmentation violation.
This doesn't always happen, but usually.  The reason is
that access to <b>ti-&gt;t</b> is not protected.

<hr>
<h2>Adding a mutex</h2>

Now look at <a href="http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~jplank/plank/classes/cs360/360/notes/Thread3/ssnserver3.c"><b>ssnserver3.c</b></a>.
This adds a mutex that each thread locks while it processes
a connection.  This solves the problem with accessing <b>t</b>,
because no two threads may access <b>t</b> simultaneously.
I.e. try out <b>kill_it.sh</b>: On <b>hydra4</b>:

<ul><pre>UNIX&gt; <font color="darkred"><b>./ssnserver3 8888</b></font>
</pre></ul>

And on <b>hydra3</b>:

<ul><pre>UNIX&gt; <font color="darkred"><b>sh kill_it.sh hydra4 8888 10000 5 &gt; &amp; /dev/null</b></font>
</pre></ul>

No core dump!  
<p>
So, this solves the mutual exclusion problem, but it is like
stapling papers with a sledge hammer.  By having each thread lock
the mutex throughout its lifetime, we have serialized the server --
no two threads can do <i>anything</i> simultaneously, and this is
a performance problem.  For example, a client could open a connection and
then do nothing, thereby disabling the server!

</p><p>
We solve this problem in a very standard way, 
with <a href="http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~jplank/plank/classes/cs360/360/notes/Thread3/ssnserver4.c"><b>ssnserver4.c</b></a>.
Instead of locking
the mutex at all times, the thread only locks the mutex when it
accesses the tree.  This is within the code for <b>ADD</b>, <b>DELETE</b>
and <b>PRINT</b>.
</p><p>
You can now test that multiple clients may indeed access the server 
simultaneously by using <b>nc</b> as the client.  
</p><p>
When I went to demonstrate the performance of the two programs, I was confronted
with something that happens all too often in computer science research.  I couldn't
make sense of the results.  What I did was the following.  I ran the <b>ssnserver3</b> on port 8889
of hydra3,
and then I ran the following on mamba, the machine on my desk:

</p><pre>UNIX&gt; <font color="darkred"><b>time sh kill_it.sh hydra3 8889 120000 10</b></font>
26.268u 11.264s 1:13.13 51.3% 0+0k 8+0io 0pf+0w
UNIX&gt;
</pre>

Next, I ran <b>ssnserver4</b> on port 8889 of hydra3:

<pre> 
UNIX&gt; <font color="darkred"><b>time sh kill_it.sh hydra3 8889 120000 10</b></font>
37.515u 15.702s 1:45.63 50.3% 0+0k 0+0io 0pf+0w
UNIX&gt;
</pre>

That is odd indeed -- 1:13 for the version that serializes everything, and
1:45 for the version that allows the clients to work in parallel.  It doesn't
make sense!

<p>
I have been a professor long enough now, to know that many students, when they get
results like these, graph them and call it a day.  You need to avoid that temptation,
and instead try to explain what is going on.  To probe further, I printed out the 
starting time of the shell script, and then the 
completion times of the 10 clients in the serialized version (their <b>time(0)</b> values):

</p><pre>T0 1524685224
T0 1524685226
T0 1524685228
T0 1524685231
T0 1524685237
T0 1524685244
T0 1524685252
T0 1524685261
T0 1524685272
T0 1524685283
T0 1524685296
</pre>

You'll note that the clients take the following times to complete: 2 seconds, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 13.  Can you explain why each client is taking longer than the next?

<p>
Here's the reason -- when the first client runs, it puts 50 elements into the tree, and then
processes its 119,950 other events.  When it's done, the tree has roughly 50 elements.  
When the second client runs, it puts 50 more elements into the tree, and then
processes its 119,950 other events.  When it's done, the tree has roughly 100 elements.
Each successive client works on a tree that gets incrementally bigger.  
</p><p>
Now, think about the clients when the server allows them to work simultaneously.  Pretty 
much instantly, the tree has 500 elements.  When means that each client has to work on a
tree of 500 elements.  The average client completion time roughly 10.5 seconds.  
</p><p>
In other words, we have set up a bad experiment to compare the two servers.  Now, I'm not
going to set up a better one, because I don't have the time, and I don't think that it adds
value to the class.  What would be better would be to write a program that populates the
tree, and then fires off clients that just do ADD/DELETE/PRINT.  
</p><p>
Remember this lecture, because you will likely see something like it in your near
future, when you are trying to analyze something involving computers.

<h2><b>ssnserver5</b></h2>

There's another improvement that you can do to your program, to increase
the amount of parallelism in it.  Think to yourself:
does the mutex really need to be locked while printing the tree?
No, not really.  You can do some buffering to help you.  Instead,
create the string that you'll be using to print the tree while
holding this mutex.  This will take some time, but not nearly as
much as writing this string to the socket.  Then you release the
mutex and write the string.  This is done in 
<a href="http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~jplank/plank/classes/cs360/360/notes/Thread3/ssnserver5.c"><b>Ssnserver5.c</b></a>.  
I wish that this improved performance more than it does -- it 
improved the time of the above test from 1:45 to 1:39.  Someday,
I'll explore this one more, but for now, just let it be known that 
it is a nice application of buffering that does improve performance
somewhat.

<hr>
<h2>The lesson to be learned</h2>

The lesson to be learned here is that you need to think carefully
about your use of synchronization primitives.  There are two issues:
correctness and performance.  You want to make sure that there are
no race conditions in your code, as there were in 
<b>ssnserver2.c</b>.  
However, you want to eliminate these race
conditions in a way that maximizes performance.  This should be
done by making sure you only hold a mutex for as long as you need
it locked.  If you are performing a very time consuming operation
(such as writing to a socket or file) while holding the mutex,
then you should consider the use of buffering so that you can 
move the time consuming operation out of the code that holds the
mutex.  This is what <b>ssnserver5</b> does.
