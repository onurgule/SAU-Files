<h1>Pipe()</h1>

First, read the pipe man page.  I've included the SunOS version
(from the 1990's) in <a href="http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~jplank/plank/classes/cs360/360/notes/Pipe/pipe.txt"><b>pipe.txt</b></a>.
It is one of the best 70 lines of text you will ever read.
It tells you all you need to know in a very terse manner.  
It is beautiful.

<p>The <b>pipe()</b> system call gives parent-child processes a way to 
communicate 
with each other.  It is called as follows:

</p><pre>int pipe(int fd[2]);
</pre>

In other words, you pass it an array of two
integers.  It fills in that array with two file
descriptors that can talk to each other.
Anything that is written on <b>fd[1]</b> may be read by
<b>fd[0]</b>.  This is of no use in a single process.
However, between processes, it gives a method of
communication.  

<p>Look at 
<b><a href="http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~jplank/plank/classes/cs360/360/notes/Pipe/pipe0.c">pipe0.c</a></b>

</p><p></p><center><table border="3" cellpadding="3"><tbody><tr><td><pre>int main()
{
  int pipefd[2];
  int i;
  char s[1000];
  char *s2;

  if (pipe(pipefd) &lt; 0) {
    perror("pipe");
    exit(1);
  }

  s2 = "Rex Morgan MD";

  write(pipefd[1], s2, strlen(s2));

  i = read(pipefd[0], s, 1000);
  s[i] = '\0';

  printf("Read %d bytes from the pipe: '%s'\n", i, s);

}
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></center><p>

This first calls <b>pipe()</b> to set up two file
descriptors <b>pipefd[0]</b> and <b>pipefd[1]</b>.  Anything
written to <b>pipefd[1]</b> can be read by <b>pipefd[0]</b>.
To put this in another way, whenever you call
<b>write(fd, buf, size)</b>, your process sends <b>size</b>
bytes starting at the address specified by <b>buf</b> to
the operating system.  The <b>fd</b> tells the operating
system what to do with those bytes.  Usually <b>fd</b>
is a file descriptor returned by <b>open()</b> -- thus,
your <b>write()</b> call tells the operating system to
write those bytes to a file.  However, there are
other types of file descriptors.  For example,
when you say <b>write(1, buf, size)</b>, you are saying
to print those bytes to standard output, which often is
not a disk file, but instead is a terminal.
When <b>fd</b> is the writing end of a pipe, the <b>write()</b>
specifies for the operating system to hold those
bytes in a buffer until some process requests for
them by performing a <b>read()</b> on the read end of
the pipe.  

</p><p>It's important to recognize that all interprocess
communication must take place through the
operating system.  Pipes are a nice clean way for
this to occur. 

</p><p>Back to 
<a href="http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~jplank/plank/classes/cs360/360/notes/Pipe/pipe0.c"><b>pipe0.c</b></a>.
After the <b>pipe()</b> system call returns in <b>pipe0</b>,
we can view the running process as
having 5 open file descriptors: standard input
(0), standard output (1), standard error (2), the
read end of the pipe (<b>pipefd[0]</b>), and the write
end of the pipe (<b>pipefd[1]</b>).  Each of those file
descriptors is a pointer to the operating system.
We can visualize it as follows: 

</p><pre>   pipe0        
|----------|      file  
| code,    |   descriptors
| globals, |                  |---------|
| heap.    |       0 &lt;-----   |         |
|          |       1 -----&gt;   |operating|
|          |       2 -----&gt;   | system  |
|          | pipefd[0] &lt;---   |         |
|          | pipefd[1] ---&gt;   |---------|
|          |
| stack    |
|----------|
</pre>

Now, we first call: "<b>write(pipefd[1], s2, strlen(s2));</b>"

<p>This sends the string <b>"Rex Morgan MD"</b> to the operating system,
which holds it in a buffer:

</p><pre>   pipe0           
|----------|      file 
| code,    |   descriptors
| globals, |                  |---------|
| heap.    |       0 &lt;-----   |         |
|          |       1 -----&gt;   |operating|
|          |       2 -----&gt;   | system  |
|          | pipefd[0] &lt;---   |         |
|          | pipefd[1] ---&gt;   |         |-&gt; "Rex Morgan MD"
|          |                  |---------|
| stack    |
|----------|
</pre>

Next, we call "<b>i = read(pipefd[0], s, 1000);</b>", which attempts to 
read up to 1000 bytes from the pipe.   This extracts the string
<b>"Rex Morgan MD"</b> from the OS and puts it into the variable <b>s</b>:

<pre>   pipe0           
|----------|      file 
| code,    |   descriptors
| globals, |                  |---------|
| heap.    |       0 &lt;-----   |         |
|          |       1 -----&gt;   |operating|
|          |       2 -----&gt;   | system  |
|          | pipefd[0] &lt;---   |         |
|          | pipefd[1] ---&gt;   |         |
|          |                  |---------|
| stack   s|-&gt; "Rex Morgan MD"
|----------|
</pre>

This is a very simple use of pipes, and is not really something that
you would ever do.  However, it shows the use of a pipe from within
one process.

<hr>
Now, look at 
<b><a href="http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~jplank/plank/classes/cs360/360/notes/Pipe/pipe1.c">pipe1.c</a></b>

<p></p><center><table border="3" cellpadding="3"><tbody><tr><td valign="top"><pre>int main()
{
  int pipefd[2];
  int pid;
  int i, line;
  char s[1000];

  if (pipe(pipefd) &lt; 0) {
    perror("pipe");
    exit(1);
  }

  pid = fork();

  <font color="blue">/* The parent reads lines of input from 
     standard input, and writes them 
     to the pipe. */</font>

  if (pid &gt; 0) {
    while(fgets(s, 1000, stdin) != NULL) {
      write(pipefd[1], s, strlen(s));
    }
</pre></td><td valign="top"><pre>  <font color="blue">/* The child reads single characters from
     the pipe, and when it sees a newline, it
     writes the line to standard output, 
     preceded by the line number. */</font>

  } else {
    i = 0;
    line = 1;
    while(read(pipefd[0], s+i, 1) == 1) {
      if (s[i] == '\n') {
        s[i] = '\0';
        printf("%6d  %s\n", line, s);
        line++;
        i = 0;
      } else {
        i++;
      }
    }
  }
  return 0;
} 
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></center><p>

</p><p>Again, after <b>pipe()</b> is called, the system looks like:

</p><pre>   pipe1           
|----------|      file 
| code,    |   descriptors
| globals, |                  |---------|
| heap.    |       0 &lt;-----   |         |
|          |       1 -----&gt;   |operating|
|          |       2 -----&gt;   | system  |
|          | pipefd[0] &lt;---   |         |
|          | pipefd[1] ---&gt;   |---------|
|          |
| stack    |
|----------|
</pre>

Now, when <b>fork()</b> is called, a new process is created which is a
duplicate of the original <b>pipe1</b> process.  
The file descriptors are also duplicated so that
they are the same pointers into the operating system.  The state now
looks like: 

<pre>pipe1(parent)                                                 pipe1(child)
|----------|      file-                                       |----------|
| code,    |   descriptors                                    | code,    |
| globals, |                  |---------|                     | globals, |
| heap.    |       0 &lt;-----   |         |  -----&gt; 0           | heap.    |
|          |       1 -----&gt;   |operating|  &lt;----- 1           |          |
|          |       2 -----&gt;   | system  |  &lt;----- 2           |          |
|          | pipefd[0] &lt;---   |         |  ---&gt; pipefd[0]     |          |
|          | pipefd[1] ---&gt;   |---------|  &lt;--- pipefd[1]     |          |
|          |                                                  |          |
| stack    |                                                  | stack    |
|----------|                                                  |----------|
</pre>

The parent process now calls <b>fgets()</b> to
read lines of text from standard input, and
writes them to the pipe.  The child reads from
the pipe, and prints each line on standard
output, preceeded by its line number.  This code
should seem straightforward to you.  You should see that
each write to <b>pipefd[1]</b> goes to the
operating system, which it passes it to the 
child process as it calls <b>read</b> on 
<b>pipefd[0]</b>.  

<p>Try running <b>pipe1</b>:

</p><pre>UNIX&gt; <font color="darkred"><b>./pipe1</b></font>
<font color="darkred"><b>How bout them Vols!</b></font>
     1  How bout them Vols!
<font color="darkred"><b>Give him six!</b></font>
     2  Give him six!
<font color="darkred"><b>Juice em, Big Dog, Juice em!</b></font>
     3  Juice em, Big Dog, Juice em!
<font color="darkred"><b>&lt;CNTL-D&gt;</b></font>
UNIX&gt;
</pre>

<p>Looks good.  Now, try doing the same thing to an output file:

</p><pre>UNIX&gt; <font color="darkred"><b>./pipe1 &gt; output</b></font>
<font color="darkred"><b>How bout them Vols!
Give him six!
Juice em, Big Dog, Juice em!
&lt;CNTL-D&gt;</b></font>
UNIX&gt; <font color="darkred"><b>cat output</b></font>
UNIX&gt;
</pre>

Hmmm.  This appears to be a problem.  Since
<b>fork()</b> duplicates file descriptors we'd assume that
the child process writes to <b>output</b>, as that is
where standard output has been redirected.  This
is correct.  The problem can be seen by doing a
<b>ps x</b> (or <b>ps aux | grep $USER</b>): 

<pre>UNIX&gt; <font color="darkred"><b>ps aux | grep plank</b></font>
...
plank     6277  0.1  0.3  760  576 pts/22   S 09:40:25  0:00 grep plank
plank     6241  0.0  0.2  684  436 pts/22   S 09:39:02  0:00 pipe1
plank     6244  0.0  0.2  700  452 pts/22   S 09:39:23  0:00 pipe1
...
UNIX&gt;
</pre>

What's going on?  Well, it can best be explained
by the picture below.  When the parent process
receives CNTL-D, it closes <b>pipefd[1]</b>, and then
exits.  The state of the system now looks as
follows: 

<pre>pipe1(parent)                                                 pipe1(child)
                                                              |----------|
exited                                                        | code,    |
                              |---------|                     | globals, |
                              |         |  -----&gt; 0           | heap.    |
                              |operating|  &lt;----- 1           |          |
                              | system  |  &lt;----- 2           |          |
                              |         |  ---&gt; pipefd[0]     |          |
                              |---------|  &lt;--- pipefd[1]     |          |
                                                              |          |
                                                              | stack    |
                                                              |----------|
</pre>

Note that the child process still has <b>pipefd[1]</b>
open.  Thus, it is waiting to read from
<b>pipefd[0]</b>, and the operating system doesn't know
that no process will be writing to <b>pipefd[1]</b>.
So the child process just sits there doing
nothing.  There is nothing in the output file
because the child is printing using <b>printf()</b>, which
buffers the output.  As the buffer isn't full, it
hasn't performed the <b>write(1, ...)</b> yet, and thus we
don't see anything in the output file.  

<p>As the <b>ps x</b> command shows, there are two <b>pipe1</b> processes 
-- one child from each of the two <b>pipe1</b>'s that
we called above.  (i.e. "<b>./pipe1</b>" and "<b>./pipe1 &gt; output</b>").

</p><p>Make sure you understand what has gone on here before you read 
further.  The child process is hung reading from <b>pipefd[0]</b>.
The <b>read()</b> call will not return because there is nothing to read,
and since <b>pipefd[1]</b> is not closed, the OS cannot make the
<b>read()</b> call return with a value of zero.  Thus, the process is
hung.

</p><hr>
Now, kill those two child processes:

<pre>UNIX&gt; <font color="darkred"><b>kill 6241 6244</b></font>
</pre>

And look at 
<a href="http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~jplank/plank/classes/cs360/360/notes/Pipe/pipe2.c"><b>pipe2.c</b></a>.
<b>Pipe2.c</b> has the parent
close the file descriptors that it is not going to
use, and it has the child close the file
descriptors that it is not going to use.  When the
parent and child both enter their loops, the
state of the system looks as follows, due to the
closing of unused file descriptors: 

<pre>pipe2(parent)     file                                        pipe2(child)
|----------|      desc-                                       |----------|
| code,    |     riptors                                      | code,    |
| globals, |                  |---------|                     | globals, |
| heap.    |       0 &lt;-----   |         |                     | heap.    |
|          |                  |operating|  &lt;----- 1           |          |
|          |       2 -----&gt;   | system  |  &lt;----- 2           |          |
|          |                  |         |  ---&gt; pipefd[0]     |          |
|          | pipefd[1] ---&gt;   |---------|                     |          |
|          |                                                  |          |
| stack    |                                                  | stack    |
|----------|                                                  |----------|
</pre>

Now, when you type <b>&lt; CNTL-D &gt;</b>, the parent exits, leaving the system in
the following state: 

<pre>pipe2(parent)                                                 pipe2(child)
                                                              |----------|
exited                                                        | code,    |
                              |---------|                     | globals, |
                              |         |                     | heap.    |
                              |operating|  &lt;----- 1           |          |
                              | system  |  &lt;----- 2           |          |
                              |         |  ---&gt; pipefd[0]     |          |
                              |---------|                     |          |
                                                              |          |
                                                              | stack    |
                                                              |----------|
</pre>

Note that the writing end of <b>pipefd</b> is gone
completely.  Thus, the operating system can have
the child's <b>read(pipefd[0], ...)</b> return zero, and
the child exits gracefully.  So, when you call
<b>pipe2</b> as you did <b>pipe1</b> before, the output file is
correctly created, and there are no child
processes left hanging around: 

<pre>UNIX&gt; <font color="darkred"><b>pipe2 &gt; output</b></font>
How bout them Vols!
Give him six!
Juice em, Big Dog, Juice em!
&lt; CNTL-D &gt;
UNIX&gt; <font color="darkred"><b>cat output</b></font>
     1  How bout them Vols!
     2  Give him six!
     3  Juice em, Big Dog, Juice em!
UNIX&gt;
</pre>

If you do a "<b>ps x</b>", you should see no <b>pipe2</b> processes.

<hr>
<h1>SIGPIPE</h1>

As you see from the program above, when you try to read from a pipe that
has no write end, the <b>read()</b> returns 0.  
When you try to write to a pipe 
that has no read end, a <b>SIGPIPE</b> signal is generated.  
If the signal isn't handled,
the program exits silently.  This is nice because it means that, for 
example, you execute:

<pre>UNIX&gt; <font color="darkred"><b>cat exec1.c | head -5 | tail -1</b></font>
</pre>

You'll notice that the first process to die will be the middle one, because
it exits after reading the first five lines of standard input.
When it exits, the other two will 
exit automatically -- <b>tail</b> 
will have <b>read()</b> return 0, and will exit,
and <b>cat</b> will try to write to an empty pipe, and thus will generate 
<b>SIGPIPE</b> and exit.

<p>Look at 
<a href="http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~jplank/plank/classes/cs360/360/notes/Pipe/pipe3.c"><b>pipe3.c</b></a>.

</p><p>It does the same thing as the others, but catches <b>SIGPIPE</b>
(If signals are unknown to you, read Chapter 10 in the book, and the
<b>signal</b> man page.  We will have a lecture on <b>signal</b> later
in the class). 
To test it, run <b>pipe3</b>;

</p><pre>UNIX&gt; <font color="darkred"><b>./pipe3</b></font>
Juice em, Big Dog, Juice em!
     1  Juice em, Big Dog, Juice em!
</pre>

Then, in another window, kill the child process -- it will be the one with 
the higher pid:

<pre>UNIX&gt; <font color="darkred"><b>ps aux | grep plank</b></font>
...
plank     7064  0.1  0.2  684  452 pts/22   S 09:44:24  0:00 pipe3
plank     7065  0.0  0.2  684  304 pts/22   S 09:44:24  0:00 pipe3
...
UNIX&gt; <font color="darkred"><b>kill 7065</b></font>
UNIX&gt;
</pre>

You'll see nothing happen in the <b>pipe3</b> window, but the child is gone.  
(Type "<b>ps aux | grep $USER</b>" again to make sure).
This means that there is no process that has <b>pipefd[0]</b> open.  
Thus, if you type into the <b>pipe3</b> process:

<pre>Give Him Six!
15454: caught a SIGPIPE
UNIX&gt;
</pre>

The <b>write()</b> to <b>pipefd[1]</b> generates <b>SIGPIPE</b>.  

<hr>
<p>This should give you enough info to do the next lab.  
(Actually, you won't need SIGPIPE in the <b>Jsh</b> lab.  That will
come up later).
To help you out,
look at the program 
<a href="http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~jplank/plank/classes/cs360/360/notes/Pipe/headsort.c"><b>headsort.c</b></a>
-- this implements:

</p><pre>"head -10 headsort.c | sort"
</pre>

and waits for it to finish.  If we don't get to it in class, go over
the code yourself.  You will find it very helpful for the <b>Jsh</b>
lab.
