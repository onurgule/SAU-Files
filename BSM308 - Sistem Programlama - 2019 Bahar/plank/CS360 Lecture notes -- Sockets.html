<h3>Introduction, and playing with sockets using <b>nc</b>.</h3>
<p>

</p><p>Sockets are the most general constructs for performing interprocess communication
(usually abbreviated IPC) in Unix.  We have seen other ways of performing
IPC.  For example, processes can communicate through files and through
pipes.  However, both of those are limited.  For example, the only way
that two processes can communicate through a pipe is if one process has
been forked by the other (or both of them have a common ancestor).  
Often we would like to have two processes
talk with each other when they are otherwise unrelated.  For example,
they can be created by different shells, different users, or on different
machines.  Sockets let us do this.
</p><p>

A socket is a construct maintained and controlled by the operating system.
You can do three basic things with a socket:

</p><ol>
<li> <b>Serve the socket:</b>  To do this, you must ask the operating system
to allow you to serve a socket with a given <i>port</i> number.  
If the operating system responds affirmatively, then you can:
<p></p></li><li> <b>Listen for and accept client connections</b>: Here  you tell the operating
system that you want to wait for clients to connect to the socket.  When they do,
the operating system will give you a handle for the connection.  This handle will
be a file descriptor.
<p></p></li><li> <b>Request a connection as a client</b>: Here you tell your operating system that
you want to request a connection to a specific port number on (potentially) a different machine.
That machine is called the <i>host</i>.
If a process on that host has served that socket and is accepting connections, then you will also
receive a file descriptor for the connection.  You and the server may now talk to each
other through your file descriptors, much like you have processes talk with each other
over pipes.
</li></ol>

The Unix program <b>nc</b> gives you a very simple mechanism for playing with sockets.
If you call it with the "-l" option, then it will serve a socket on that port and accept
a connection.  You can call <b>nc</b> with a host and port number, and it will request a
connection.  When the connection is made, the two <b>nc</b> processes may communicate 
with each other through standard input.  Below, I show a communication with a server on 
<b>hydra1</b> and a client on <b>hydra2</b>:

There are a lot of options to <b>nc</b>, so you should play with it for a bit.

<h3>Socket Rules At The University of Tennessee</h3>

Unfortunately, sockets have historically been exploited for security violations, so our department
is relatively strict about them.  You should be aware of the following:

<ul>
<li> You cannot serve a socket on our departmental machines, and connect to it from a non-departmental machine.  That includes machines that are on UT's wireless network (because those are not departmental).  If you want to serve such a socket, you'll need to talk with our IT support.  
<p>
</p></li><li> If you want to serve a socket on a departmental machine that can only be connected to by other departmental machines, then use a port number between 8000 and 2<sup>16</sup>-1.  The low number
used to be 500, then 5000.  I assume it will continue to go up
<p>
</p></li><li> You can serve sockets on your laptops just fine, but you'll pretty much only be able to
connect to them from clients on the same laptop.  Use "localhost" as the host.  You can probably
do some fun stuff with your own local area networks, but you won't be able to serve sockets
externally to them.
<p>
</p></li><li> The main client program that I used to use was called <b>telnet</b>.  I will talk about it
in the lecture notes.  However, it has been deleted from our departmental machines.  The reason is that telnet's main use years ago (and I mean *years* ago) was to remotely log into machines on port 23.  However, everything was sent in the clear.  This is why ssh first came about.  It seems to me that the solution to this is to disable the servers on port 23, rather than to delete telnet, but no one asked me.
</li></ul>


<hr>
This lecture focuses on programming with sockets, as implemented by
the program <a href="http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~jplank/plank/classes/cs360/360/notes/Sockets/sockettome.c"><b>sockettome.c</b></a> (name
provided by Harrison "Jay" Cross, a student in my CS360 class in
2011).

<p>The Unix socket interface is one of the more arcane things you'll ever
run into.  It is for that reason that instead of using that
directly, you'll be using the following three procedures from 
<b>sockettome.c</b>:

</p><p><i>(On some machines, you have to use some special linking options -- 
When you make your final executable,  On others, you don't need it -- be
prepared to be flexible when you're testing your code on multiple machines.)</i>

</p><pre>int serve_socket(int port);
		<font color="blue">/* This serves a socket on the current machine with the given 
		   port number.  It returns an fd for that socket.  */</font>

int accept_connection(int s);
		<font color="blue">/* This accepts a connection on the given socket (i.e.
                   it should only be called by the server).  It returns
                   the fd for the connection.  This fd is of course r/w */</font>

int request_connection(char *hn, int port);
		<font color="blue">/* This is what the client calls to connect to a server's
                   port.  It returns the fd for the connection. */</font>
</pre>
Sockets work as follows:

<p>One process "serves" a socket.  By doing this, it tells the operating
system to set up a ``port'' identified by a port number.  This is the
handle by which other processes may connect with the serving process.
There is a nice analogy of sockets to a telephone.  A socket is like
a telephone, and the port number is like a telephone number.  The
machine name is like the area code.  Thus, in order for someone to
"call you up", they need to request a connection to your area
code/port number, just like making a phone call.  

</p><p>When you "serve" a socket, you are setting yourself up with a
telephone and a telephone number.  The result of serving a socket is
a file descriptor.  However, it is not a normal file descriptor upon
which you may read and write.  Instead, the only things you can
really do with it are close it (which tells Unix to not let other
processes connect to that port), or accept connections on it. 

</p><p>The server accepts a connection on a socket file descriptor by calling
<b>accept_connection()</b>.  <b>Accept_connection()</b> 
only returns when another
process has connected to the socket.  It returns a new file
descriptor which is the handle to the connection.  This descriptor is r/w.  
If you <b>write()</b> to it, the bytes will go to the connected
process, and if you <b>read()</b> from it, it will read bytes written by the
connected process. 

</p><p>Clients connect with servers by calling
<b>request_connection()</b>.  They must specify the host and the port of the
server, This is like initiating a phone call.  If the host/port combination is
being server, and if the server is calling <b>accept_connection()</b>, then
<b>request_connection()</b> returns a file
descriptor for its end of the connection.  The client uses it like the server
uses the file descriptor from <b>accept_connection()</b>.

</p><p>Once a socket has been served, it may be connected to multiple times.
That is, the serving process may call <b>accept_connection()</b> any number
of times, as long as there are other processes calling
<b>request_connection()</b> to that machine and port number.  This is kind
of like having multiple phone lines with one telephone number.
This will be useful when you write <b>jtalk</b> with more than two people. 

</p><hr>
Let's look at some example code.  Start with 
<b><a href="http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~jplank/plank/classes/cs360/360/notes/Sockets/serve1.c">serve1.c</a></b>:

<p></p><center><table border="3" cellpadding="3"><tbody><tr><td><pre>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;
#include "sockettome.h"

<font color="blue">/* This program serves a socket on the given port, and

   to this program with nc. */</font>

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
  char *un, c, s[1000];
  int port, sock, fd;

  <font color="blue">/* Parse the command line and error check. */</font>

  if (argc != 2) {
    fprintf(stderr, "usage: serve1 port\n");
    exit(1);
  }

  port = atoi(argv[1]);
  if (port &lt; 8000) {
    fprintf(stderr, "usage: serve1 port\n");
    fprintf(stderr, "       port must be &gt; 8000\n");
    exit(1);
  }

  <font color="blue">/* Serve the socket and accept the connection. */</font>

  sock = serve_socket(port);
  fd = accept_connection(sock);

  <font color="blue">/* Send the username along the socket. */</font>

  un = getenv("USER");
  printf("Connection established.  Sending `Server: %s'\n", un);
  sprintf(s, "Server: %s\n", un);
  write(fd, s, strlen(s));

  <font color="blue">/* Read a line of text, one character at a time. */</font>
  printf("Receiving:\n\n");
  do {
    if (read(fd, &amp;c, 1) != 1) {
      printf("Socket Closed Prematurely\n");
      exit(0);
    } else putchar(c);
  } while (c != '\n');

  exit(0);
}
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></center><p>
</p><p><b>Serve1.c</b> takes one argument -- the port number of a 
socket to serve.  This port number should be greater
than 8000.  This is because smaller port numbers may be used for other
Unix programs.

</p><p><b>Serve1.c</b> serves a socket and then waits to
accept a connection.  Once it receives that
connection, it sends the string <b>"Server: "</b>, then
the username of the owner of the serving process,
and a newline to the other end of the connection.
Then it reads bytes from the connection and
prints them out until it gets a newline.  Once
done, it exits.  

You can test <b>serve1</b> by running a <b>nc</b> client on another machine.  
As mentioned above, you can use
<b>nc</b> to be a generic client that attaches to a server, then it does two things:
</p><p>
</p><ol> 
<li> It reads lines from standard input and sends them along the connection.
</li><li> It reads lines from the socket and prints them to standard output.
</li></ol>

Below, I run the server on hydra3, and the client on hydra4.  I have padded this output with
extra lines so that you can see the timing of things relative to each other.

<p></p><center><table border="3" cellpadding="3"><tbody><tr><td valign="top">
On hydra3:<hr>
<pre>UNIX&gt; <font color="darkred"><b>./serve1 8888</b></font>

<td valign="top">

Connection closed by foreign host.
UNIX&gt; <font color="darkred"><b></b></font>
</pre>
</td></tr></tbody></table></center><p>

As you can see, the two processes connect with each other and send the bytes
back and forth.  Easy enough.  Now, a few mundane details.  First, suppose I try to run the
server again quickly:

</p><pre>UNIX&gt; <font color="darkred"><b>./serve1 8888</b></font>
bind(): Address already in use
UNIX&gt; <font color="darkred"><b></b></font>
</pre>

This happens because the operating system holds the port number typically for two minutes
before allowing you to reuse it.  Be prepared.  
<p>

If you look at that <b>do/while</b> loop above, you'll not that it's really inefficient.  It
reads one character at a time, and we know from our experience with buffering that this is
a bad thing.  You may want to try doing <b>read()</b>'s of larger numbers.  That's a fine thing,
but you need to be aware that with sockets, <i>any</i> number of bytes can come back from 
a <b>read()</b> call -- it does not necessarily have to match the corresponding <b>write()</b>
call, or newlines, or, frankly, anything.  
That makes it a pain to do things like reading until you receive a newline.  You may
be tempted to the <b>do/while</b> loop above, but please resist the temptation.  There is a 
better way, illustrated in the next program:
</p><p>
<b><a href="http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~jplank/plank/classes/cs360/360/notes/Sockets/serve2.c">Serve2.c</a></b> changes <b>serve1.c</b> in how it writes to the client:

</p><p></p><center><table border="3" cellpadding="3"><tbody><tr><td><pre>  <font color="blue">/* Here is a new variable declaration */</font>
  FILE *fsock;

  <font color="blue"> .................</font>

  <font color="blue">/* Here's the new code -- see how you can use fgets now, instead of read(). */</font>

  fsock = fdopen(fd, "r");

  if (fgets(s, 1000, fsock) == NULL) {
    printf("Error -- socket closed\n");
  } else {
    printf("%s", s);
  }
  return 0;
}
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></center><p>
<b>Fdopen()</b> is just like <b>fopen()</b>, except it takes an open
file descriptor as an argument rather than a file.  This allows you
to use the familiar primitives from the standard I/O library, which
have been implemented with sockets in mind.  In particular, they do
the proper buffering and read retrying to make sure that you read
what you want efficiently.  In <b>serve2.c</b>, we use <b>fgets()</b>
to read the line from the client.

</p><hr>
<h2>Adding a client</h2>

<b><a href="http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~jplank/plank/classes/cs360/360/notes/Sockets/client1.c">Client1.c</a></b>
is very similar to <b>serve2.c</b>.  It simply has a client connect using
<b>request_connection()</b>.  It receives the line of text from the server and sends a line of
its own.  Here it is working:

<p></p><center><table border="3" cellpadding="3"><tbody><tr><td valign="top">
On hydra3:<hr>
<pre>UNIX&gt; <font color="darkred"><b>./serve2 8888</b></font>
Connection established.  Sending `Server: plank'
Receiving:

Client: plank
UNIX&gt; 
</pre>
</td>
<td valign="top">
On hydra4:<hr>
<pre>UNIX&gt; <font color="darkred"><b>./client1 hydra3 8888</b></font>
Connection established.  Receiving:

Received: Server: plank
Sending `Client: plank' to the server
UNIX&gt; <font color="darkred"><b></b></font>
</pre>
</td></tr></tbody></table></center><p>

Go over both programs until you understand all this.  If you run
"<b>client1</b>" before "<b>serve2</b>", that's ok.  It will wait until
the socket is served.  

</p><p><b>Client1</b> can be run from any machine and any user.  
For example, 
I got Dr. Vander Zanden to try
this from his machine:

</p><p></p><center><table border="3" cellpadding="3"><tbody><tr><td valign="top">
My output on hydra3:
<hr>
<pre>UNIX&gt; <font color="darkred"><b>./serve1 8001</b></font>

UNIX&gt;
</pre></td><td valign="top">

Received: Server: plank
Sending `Client: bvz' to the server
UNIX&gt;
</pre>
</td></tr></tbody></table><p></p></center>


<hr>
<h2>Alternate</h2>

Now, suppose I want to write a limited version of "talk" -- It will let
a server/client pair establish a connection, and then alternate sending
lines to one another.  
This is in
<a href="http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~jplank/plank/classes/cs360/360/notes/Sockets/alternate.c"><b>alternate.c</b></a>.
Each process alternates reading a line from <b>stdin</b> and sending
it along the socket, and then reading a line from the socket and sending
it along <b>stdout</b>.

<p>Try running <b>alternate</b> from two windows on the same machine, or from 
two different machines, or from two different users on different machines.

Here is an example of the server on hydra3 and the client on hydra4.  
Pay attention to the part where the client writes before the server is ready
(it's the line "While combing my hair now"), and what the output is:

</p><p></p><center><table border="3" cellpadding="3"><tbody><tr><td valign="top">

<h2>Minitalk</h2>

You'll note that <b>alternate</b> isn't totally useful.  What you'd like is
for each end of the connection to simultaneously wait for the user to 
type a line in on <b>stdin</b> and for a line to come in from the socket.  
You'll be able to do that with <b>select()</b> which we'll go over next lecture.
Until then, you can hack up a version of <b>talk()</b> which uses 4 total
processes -- two for the client and two for the server.  One 
client-server pair just lets the client type lines in and it prints
it out to the server, and the other lets the server type lines in 
and it prints it out to the client.  This is in 
<a href="http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~jplank/plank/classes/cs360/360/notes/Sockets/minitalk1.c"><b>minitalk1.c</b></a>.
Note
that minitalk1 <b>dups</b> the <b>fd</b> onto 0 or 1 depending on whether the 
process is the parent or child, and then exec's cat in all four processes.
This is a real hack, but it works -- you have the server parent 
reading from its stdin and sending the output along the socket to the
client child, and likewise from the client parent to the server child.

<p>
Here's the relevant code:

</p><p></p><center><table border="3" cellpadding="3"><tbody><tr><td><pre>  .....

  printf("Connection made -- input goes to remote site\n");
  printf("                   output comes from remote site\n");

  if (fork() == 0) {
    dup2(fd, 0);
  } else {
    dup2(fd, 1);
  }
  close(fd);
  execlp("cat", "cat", 0);
  fprintf(stderr, "Exec failed.  Drag\n");
  exit(1);
}
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></center><p>

</p><p>The only problem with <b>minitalk1</b> is that once one of the processes dies,
the others don't automatically follow suit.  Think about why.
Also think about what would happen if you swapped the parent and the child (in other
words, if you had the parent perform <b>dup2(fd, 0)</b> and the child perform
<b>dup2(fd, 1)</b>.  Try it to test yourself.
</p><p>
When you run <b>minitalk1</b>, after you finish, type "ps" and kill extraneous
"cat" processes.

You can fix the problem by adding another process to the mix.  Instead of 
forking one process, you fork two, and have them both do the <b>execlp</b>
of <b>cat</b>.  Then you call <b>wait()</b>, and when one of the processes
dies, you kill the other one.  That cleans up all of the processes -- try it
for yourself!  The code is in 
<b><a href="http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~jplank/plank/classes/cs360/360/notes/Sockets/minitalk2.c">minitalk2.c</a></b> -- here's the relevant section:

<h3>A Final Minitalk - One Connection Per Direction</h3>

Here's a final version of <b>minitalk</b>.  It's a good one to go over, as
this is the kind of question I like to have you code up in class.  What
we're going to do is have a very similar structure to the last <b>minitalk</b>,
only now we are going to have two connections between the client and the
server.  The client and server will each fork off two children, and then 
each set of children will communicate exclusively with its own socket
connection.

<p>
The code is in 
<b><a href="http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~jplank/plank/classes/cs360/360/notes/Sockets/minitalk3.c">minitalk3.c</a></b>.    I'll break it into a
few parts.  The first part contains the headers, variable declarations
and parses the command line:

</p><p></p><center><table border="3" cellpadding="3"><tbody><tr><td><pre>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;
#include &lt;signal.h&gt;
#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;
#include "sockettome.h"

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
  char *hn;
  int port, socket;   <font color="blue">/* Port number, and socket fd for server */</font>
  int conn1, conn2;   <font color="blue">/* FD's for the two connections */</font>
  int pid1, pid2;     <font color="blue">/* Process id's of the two children */</font>
  int pid, dummy;;    <font color="blue">/* Used by the parent when it calls wait() */</font>
  int id;             <font color="blue">/* ID of process -- Parent/C1/C2: 'P', '1' or '2' */</font>
  int cs;             <font color="blue">/* 'c' or 's' - client or server */</font>

  if (argc != 4) {
    fprintf(stderr, "usage: minitalk hostname port s|c\n");
    exit(1);
  }

  hn = argv[1];
  port = atoi(argv[2]);
  if (port &lt; 8000) {
    fprintf(stderr, "usage: minitalk hostname port s|c\n");
    fprintf(stderr, "       port must be &gt; 8000\n");
    exit(1);
  }

}
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></center><p>

The next part has the server serve a socket and accept two connections,
while the client requests two connections.  When this code is done,
the system looks as so:

</p><p></p><center><table border="3"><tbody><tr><td><img src="./CS360 Lecture notes -- Sockets_files/MT1.jpg"></td></tr></tbody></table></center><p>

</p><p></p><center><table border="3" cellpadding="3"><tbody><tr><td><pre>  <font color="blue">/* Set up the connections */</font>

  if (strcmp(argv[3], "s") == 0) {
    cs = 's';
    socket = serve_socket(port);
    conn1 = accept_connection(socket);
    conn2 = accept_connection(socket);
    close(socket);
  } else if (strcmp(argv[3], "c") == 0) {
    cs = 'c';
    conn1 = request_connection(hn, port);
    conn2 = request_connection(hn, port);
  } else {
    fprintf(stderr, "usage: minitalk hostname port s|c\n");
    fprintf(stderr, "       last argument must be `s' or `c'\n");
    exit(1);
  }

</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></center><p>

The last part of the code does all of the magic, having the two sets of
children talk, each with their own connection.  Here's how it looks 
pictorally:

And here's the code that makes it happen.  As with <b>minitalk2</b>, when
one child dies, the parent kills the other child:

</p><p></p><center><table border="3" cellpadding="3"><tbody><tr><td><pre>  <font color="blue">/* Set up parent and two children.  In the parent,
     pid1 and pid2 are the process id's of the children */</font>

  pid1 = fork();
  if (pid1 == 0) {
    id = '1';
  } else {
    pid2 = fork();
    if (pid2 == 0) {
      id = '2';
    } else {
      id = 'P';
    }
  }

  <font color="blue">/* Connect C1 of the server to C2 of the client */</font>

  if (id == '1' &amp;&amp; cs == 's') dup2(conn1, 1);
  if (id == '2' &amp;&amp; cs == 'c') dup2(conn1, 0);

  <font color="blue">/* Connect C1 of the client to C2 of the server */</font>

  if (id == '1' &amp;&amp; cs == 'c') dup2(conn2, 1);
  if (id == '2' &amp;&amp; cs == 's') dup2(conn2, 0);

  <font color="blue">/* Everyone (parent included) closes the connections */</font>

  close(conn1);
  close(conn2);

  <font color="blue">/* Have the parent call wait, and then kill the other child */</font>

  if (id == 'P') {
    pid = wait(&amp;dummy);
    if (pid == pid1) {
      kill(pid2, SIGKILL);
    } else {
      kill(pid1, SIGKILL);
    }
    exit(0);
  }

  <font color="blue">/* Otherwise, have the children execlp cat */</font>

  execlp("cat", "cat", NULL);
  fprintf(stderr, "Exec failed.  Drag\n");
  exit(1);
}
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></center><p>
