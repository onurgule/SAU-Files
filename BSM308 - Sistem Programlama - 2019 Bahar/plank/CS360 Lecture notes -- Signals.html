<h1>Signals</h1>

<p>Signals are complex flow-of-control operations.  A signal is an
interruption of the program of some sort.  For example, when you press
<b>CNTL-C</b>, that sends the <b>SIGINT</b> signal to your program.
When you press <b>CNTL-\</b>, that sends the <b>SIGQUIT</b> signal to
your program.  When you generate a segmentation violation, that sends
the <b>SIGSEGV</b> signal to your program.  

</p><p>Your program has various ways of dealing with
signals.  By default, there are certain actions
that take place.  For example, which you press
<b>CNTL-C</b> or <b>CNTL-\</b>, the program usually exits.  
That is the default action for <b>SIGINT</b> and <b>SIGQUIT</b>.  
When you get a segmentation violation, your program
spits out an error message, potentially creates a core dump, and
then exits.  That is the default
<b>SIGSEGV</b>. 

</p><p>You can redefine what happens when you get these
signals, which allows you to write very flexible
programs.  Internally, when a signal is
generated, the operating system takes over from
the currently running program.  It saves the
current state of the program on the stack.  Then,
it calls an "interrupt handler" for the specific
signal.  For example, the default interrupt
handlers for <b>SIGINT</b> and <b>SIGQUIT</b> cause the program to exit.
The default interrupt handler for <b>SIGSEGV</b>
prints and error, potentially causes the program to dump core, and then
exits.  If the interrupt handler for a signal calls
<b>return</b>, then what happens is that the operating
system takes over again, and restores the program
from the state that it has saved on the stack.
The program resumes from where it left off.

</p><p>You can use the <b>signal()</b> function to define
interrupt handlers for signals.  As always, read
the man page: <b>man signal</b>.

</p><p>For example, look at 
<a href="http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~jplank/plank/classes/cs360/360/notes/Signals/sh1.c"><b>sh1.c</b></a>:

</p><p></p><center><table border="3" cellpadding="3"><tbody><tr><td><pre>#include &lt;signal.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

void cntl_c_handler(int dummy)
{
  signal(SIGINT, cntl_c_handler);
  printf("You just typed cntl-c\n");
}

int main()
{
  int i, j;

  signal(SIGINT, cntl_c_handler);

  for (j = 0; j &lt; 2000; j++) {
    for (i = 0; i &lt; 1000000; i++);
  }
  return 0;
}
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></center><p>

</p><p>What this does is set up a signal handler for
<b>SIGINT</b>.  Now, when the user presses <b>CNTL-C</b>, the
operating system will save the current execution
state of the program, and then execute
<b>cntl_c_handler</b>.  When <b>cntl_c_handler</b> returns, the
operating system resumes the program from where
it was interrupted.  Thus, when you run <b>sh1</b>, each
time you type <b>CNTL-C</b>, it will print <b>"You just typed cntl-c"</b>, 
and the program will continue.  It
will exit by itself in 10 seconds or so. 

</p><p>The signal handler should follow the prototype of <b>cntl_c_handler</b>.
In other words it should return a <b>(void)</b> (i.e. nothing), and should
accept an integer argument, even if it will not use the argument.
Otherwise, <b>gcc</b> will complain to you.

</p><p>Also, note that I make a <b>signal()</b> call in the signal handler.
On some systems, if you do <i>not</i> do this, then it will reinstall
the default signal handler for <b>CNTL-C</b> once it has handled the
signal.  On some systems, you don't have to make the extra <b>signal()</b>
call.  Such is life in the land of multiple Unix's.

</p><hr>
<p>You can handle each different signal with a call
to <b>signal()</b>.  For example, 
<a href="http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~jplank/plank/classes/cs360/360/notes/Signals/sh1a.c"><b>sh1a.c</b></a>
defines different
signal handlers for <b>CNTL-C</b> (which is <b>SIGINT</b>),
and <b>CNTL-\</b> (which is <b>SIGQUIT</b>).  They print out
the values of <b>i</b> and <b>j</b> when the signal is
generated.  Note that <b>i</b> and <b>j</b> must be global
variables for this to work.  This is one example
when you have to use global variables.

</p><p>Try this out by compiling the program and then running it, and pressing
<b>CNTL-C</b> and <b>CNTL-\</b> a bunch of times:

</p><pre>UNIX&gt; <font color="darkred"><b>./sh1a</b></font>
<font color="darkred"><b>^C</b></font>You just typed cntl-c.  j is 2 and i is 539943
<font color="darkred"><b>^C</b></font>You just typed cntl-c.  j is 2 and i is 919180
<font color="darkred"><b>^\</b></font>You just typed cntl-\.  j is 4 and i is 413031
<font color="darkred"><b>^C</b></font>You just typed cntl-c.  j is 5 and i is 20458
<font color="darkred"><b>^\</b></font>You just typed cntl-\.  j is 6 and i is 73316
<font color="darkred"><b>^\</b></font>You just typed cntl-\.  j is 6 and i is 683034
<font color="darkred"><b>^C</b></font>You just typed cntl-c.  j is 7 and i is 292244
<font color="darkred"><b>^C</b></font>You just typed cntl-c.  j is 13 and i is 738661
<font color="darkred"><b>^\</b></font>You just typed cntl-\.  j is 14 and i is 789583
<font color="darkred"><b>^\</b></font>You just typed cntl-\.  j is 16 and i is 42225
<font color="darkred"><b>^\</b></font>You just typed cntl-\.  j is 16 and i is 209458
<font color="darkred"><b>^C</b></font>You just typed cntl-c.  j is 17 and i is 260584
<font color="darkred"><b>^\</b></font>You just typed cntl-\.  j is 19 and i is 982514
UNIX&gt;
</pre>

<p>You can also catch the segmentation violation signal.  One 
of those CS legends is that some grad student used to 
put the following into his code:

</p><p></p><center><table border="3" cellpadding="3"><tbody><tr><td><pre>#include &lt;signal.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

void segv_handler(int dummy)
{
  signal(SIGINT, sint_handler);
  fprintf(stderr, "nfs server not responding, still trying\n");
  while(1) ;
}

int main()
...
  signal(SIGSEGV, segv_handler();

  rest of the code
}
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></center><p>

This is so that if he was demo-ing his code, and a segmentation violation
occured (which always seems to happen when you're demo-ing code), it 
would look like the network had frozen.  Very clever.  (I.e. look at
and run 
<a href="http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~jplank/plank/classes/cs360/360/notes/Signals/sh1b.c"><b>sh1b.c</b></a>.
It should cause a segmentation violation, but instead
looks like the network is hanging).  Note also that <b>CNTL-C</b> is disabled, since that's
what happens when NFS hangs.

</p><hr>
<h1>Alarm()</h1>

<p>Another use of signal handlers is the "alarm
clock" that Unix provides.  Read the man page for
<b>alarm()</b>.  What <b>alarm(n)</b> does is
return, and then <b>n</b> seconds later, it will cause
the <b>SIGALRM</b> signal to occur.  If you have set a
signal handler for it, then you can catch the
signal, and do whatever it is that you wanted to
do.  For example, 
<a href="http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~jplank/plank/classes/cs360/360/notes/Signals/sh2.c"><b>sh2.c</b></a>
is like 
<a href="http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~jplank/plank/classes/cs360/360/notes/Signals/sh1.c"><b>sh1.c</b></a>, only it
prints out a message after the program has
executed 3 seconds.  <b>alarm()</b> is
approximate -- it's not exactly 3 seconds, but
we'll consider it close enough for the purposes
of this class.  

</p><pre>UNIX&gt; <font color="darkred"><b>./sh2</b></font>
Three seconds just passed: j = 1245.  i = 287469
UNIX&gt;
</pre>

Finally, 
<a href="http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~jplank/plank/classes/cs360/360/notes/Signals/sh3.c"><b>sh3.c</b></a>
shows how you can get Unix to send you <b>SIGALRM</b> every second.
It's just a tweak to 
<a href="http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~jplank/plank/classes/cs360/360/notes/Signals/sh2.c"><b>sh2.c</b></a>
where you have the alarm handler call alarm
to make Unix generate <b>SIGALRM</b> one second after the current one.  
I'll include the code below:

<p></p><center><table border="3" cellpadding="3"><tbody><tr><td><pre>int i, j, seconds;

void alarm_handler(int dummy)
{
  seconds++;
  printf("%d second%s just passed: j = %4d.  i = %6d\n", seconds,
     (seconds == 1) ? " " : "s", j, i);
  signal(SIGALRM, alarm_handler);
  alarm(1);
}

int main()
{
  seconds = 0;

  signal(SIGALRM, alarm_handler);
  alarm(1);

  for (j = 0; j &lt; 2000; j++) {
    for (i = 0; i &lt; 1000000; i++);
  }
  return 0;
}
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></center><p>

</p><pre>UNIX&gt; <font color="darkred"><font color="darkred"><b>./sh3</b></font></font>
1 second  just passed: j =  398.  i = 804296
2 seconds just passed: j =  804.  i = 487960
3 seconds just passed: j = 1210.  i = 977119
4 seconds just passed: j = 1605.  i = 627513
5 seconds just passed: j = 1997.  i = 468054
UNIX&gt;
</pre>

On some systems, when you are in a signal handler for one signal, 
you cannot process that same signal again until the handler returns.  
On other systems, you can handle that same signal again.
For example, look at 
<a href="http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~jplank/plank/classes/cs360/360/notes/Signals/sh4.c"><b>sh4.c</b></a> -- here's the code for the signal
handlers:

<p></p><center><table border="3" cellpadding="3"><tbody><tr><td><pre><font color="blue">/* Put a while loop into the alarm handler, to see if it
   can catch SIGALRM while it's in the alarm handler. */</font>

int i, j;

void cntl_bs_handler(int dummy)
{
  printf("SIGQUIT generated: j = %d.  i = %d\n", j, i);
  signal(SIGQUIT, cntl_bs_handler);
}

void alarm_handler(int dummy)
{
  printf("One second has passed: j = %d.  i = %d\n", j, i);
  signal(SIGALRM, alarm_handler);
  alarm(1);
  while(1);
}
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></center><p>

</p><p><b>Alarm_handler()</b> has an infinite loop in it, meaning that
it never returns.   The program runs for a second, and then <b>SIGALRM</b>
is generated, and <b>alarm_handler()</b> is entered.  It goes into
an infinite loop, and one second later, <b>SIGALRM</b> is generated
again.  Depending on your version of Unix, different things may happen.
For example, on my Macbook in 2018, I got the following:

</p><pre>UNIX&gt; <font color="darkred"><b>./sh4</b></font>
One second has passed: j = 476.  i = 853593
<font color="blue">(and it hangs)</font>
</pre>

In other words, the signal was to be ignored until
you return from <b>alarm_handler()</b>, which of course never happened.

<p>Here was the output on Solaris in something like 1996:

</p><pre>UNIX&gt; <font color="darkred"><font color="darkred"><b>sh4</b></font></font>
One second has passed: j = 7.  i = 697646
One second has passed: j = 7.  i = 697646
One second has passed: j = 7.  i = 697646
One second has passed: j = 7.  i = 697646
...
</pre>

In other words, you could catch <b>SIGALRM</b> from <b>SIGALRM</b>.

Which output does your operating system produce?
<p>
You can generate and handle other signals reliably whether in a signal
handler or not.  For example, when
you press <b>CNTL-\</b> in <b>sh4.c</b>, it gets caught properly 
whether the program 
or the <b>alarm_handler()</b> is running -- give it a try.

Here's an interesting question -- when <b>SIGALRM</b> is generated, and I'm 
in the alarm handler code, is the signal simply ignored, or is it queued until
the alarm handler returns?  Here's a program,
(<b><a href="http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~jplank/plank/classes/cs360/360/notes/Signals/sh5.c">sh5.c</a></b>),
that tests this:  

</p><p></p><center><table border="3" cellpadding="3"><tbody><tr><td><pre>int i, j;

void alarm_handler(int dummy)
{
  printf("One second has passed: j = %d.  i = %d\n", j, i);
  signal(SIGALRM, alarm_handler);
  alarm(1);

  for (; j &lt; 2000; j++) {
    for (i = 0; i &lt; 1000000; i++);
  }
}

int main()
{
  signal(SIGALRM, alarm_handler);
  alarm(1);

  for (j = 0; j &lt; 2000; j++) {
    for (i = 0; i &lt; 1000000; i++);
  }
  return 0;
}
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></center><p>

When you run this program, here's the output: 

</p><pre>UNIX&gt; <font color="darkred"><b>./sh5</b></font>
One second has passed: j = 521.  i = 723701
One second has passed: j = 2000.  i = 1000000
UNIX&gt; <font color="darkred"><b></b></font>
</pre>

Here's what happened:

<ul>
<li> The <b>main()</b> runs until <b>j</b>=521 and <b>i=723701</b>.
</li><li> <b>SIGALRM</b> is generated, and the alarm handler runs, calling <b>alarm(1)</b> and 
     then continuing to update <b>j</b> and <b>i</b>.  
</li><li> One second later, <b>SIGALRM</b> is generated again, but since the alarm handler is
     running, it is queued in the operating system.
</li><li> When the first alarm handler returns, <b>SIGALRM</b> is delivered to the program, and
    the alarm handler is called for a second time.  It prints that <b>j</b> is 2000, and 
    <b>i</b> is 1000000, and returns; it calls <b>alarm(1)</b> again, and then returns.  
</li><li> <b>Main()</b> then returns, and the program returns.  
</li></ul>

<p>Finally, you can send any signal to a program
with the <b>kill</b> command.  Read the man page.
Signal number 9 (<b>SIGKILL</b>) cannot be caught by
your program, meaning that you cannot write a
signal handler for it.  This is nice because if
you mess up writing a signal handler, then "<b>kill -9</b>" 
is the only way to kill the program.  

</p><hr>
<h3>Alarm() and exec</h3>

Here's another interesting question: If you call <b>alarm(2)</b>, and then 
you call <b>execlp</b> or one of its variants, then your memory is overwritten
by a new program, and the <b>execlp()</b> call doesn't return (because it can't).
Does the <b>SIGALRM</b> signal still get delivered?

<p>
Here is a simple program 
(<b><a href="http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~jplank/plank/classes/cs360/360/notes/Signals/call_exec.c">call_exec.c</a></b>)
to answer that question:

</p><p></p><center><table border="3" cellpadding="3"><tbody><tr><td><pre>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;

int main()
{
  alarm(2);
  execl("sh1", "sh1", NULL);
  perror("execl");
  return 0;
}
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></center><p>

It calls <b>alarm(2)</b>, and then <b>execl</b> for the program <b>sh1</b> -- this is the program
that only catches <b>SIGINT</b>.  When we run this, we see that <b>sh1</b> is indeed killed by 
<b>SIGLARM</b>:

</p><pre>UNIX&gt; <font color="darkred"><b>./call_exec</b></font>
<font color="blue">(Two seconds pass)</font>
Alarm clock
UNIX&gt; <font color="darkred"><b></b></font>
</pre>

<hr>
<h3>SIGPIPE and the Stdio Library</h3>

When you write to a file descriptor that has no read end, the <b>SIGPIPE</b> signal will
be generated.  If uncaught, it will kill your program.  Unfortunately, since the operating
system often does its own buffering of writes, you don't usually generate <b>SIGPIPE</b>
as soon as you should.  It usually comes later.  This can prove difficult to handle.
<p>
Let's take a look at the interaction of <b>SIGPIPE</b> and the standard I/O library, since
that's usually where you are when <b>SIGPIPE</b> is generated.  Take a look at
<b><a href="http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~jplank/plank/classes/cs360/360/notes/Signals/sigpipe_1.c">sigpipe_1.c</a></b>

</p><p></p><center><table border="3" cellpadding="3"><tbody><tr><td><pre>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

int main()
{
  int i;
  char *s = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ\n";

  i = 0;
  while (1) {
    if (fputs(s, stdout) == EOF) {
      fprintf(stderr, "Died on iteration %d on fputs\n", i);
      exit(0);
    }
    if (fflush(stdout) != 0) {
      fprintf(stderr, "Died on iteration %d on fflush\n", i);
      exit(0);
    }
    fprintf(stderr, "Iteration %d done\n", i);
    i++;
  }
  return 0;
}
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></center><p>

We're going to pipe this program into "<b>head -n 1</b>."  You would think that
this would generate <b>SIGPIPE</b> on the second <b>fflush()</b>, since <b>head</b>
will exit after reading the first line.  However, we get something different from
what we expect (the exact output will of course differ from machine to machine and
even from run to run):

</p><pre>UNIX&gt; <font color="darkred"><b>./sigpipe_1 | head -n 1</b></font>
Iteration 0 done
Iteration 1 done
...
Iteration 2414 done
ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
Iteration 2415 done
Iteration 2416 done
UNIX&gt; <font color="darkred"><b>./sigpipe_1 | head -n 1</b></font>
Iteration 0 done
Iteration 1 done
...
Iteration 2094 done
ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
Iteration 2095 done
Iteration 2096 done
UNIX&gt; 
</pre>

Since we don't get an error statement, we can assume that <b>SIGPIPE</b> was generated
and killed the process.  
<b><a href="http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~jplank/plank/classes/cs360/360/notes/Signals/sigpipe_2.c">sigpipe_2.c</a></b> catches the signal and ignores it:

<p></p><center><table border="3" cellpadding="3"><tbody><tr><td><pre>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;signal.h&gt;

void sigpipe_handler(int dummy)
{
  fprintf(stderr, "Ignoring Sigpipe()\n");
  signal(SIGPIPE, sigpipe_handler);
}

int main()
{
  int i;
  char *s = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ\n";

  signal(SIGPIPE, sigpipe_handler);
  i = 0;
  while (1) {
    if (fputs(s, stdout) == EOF) {
      fprintf(stderr, "Died on iteration %d on fputs\n", i);
      exit(0);
    }
    if (fflush(stdout) != 0) {
      fprintf(stderr, "Died on iteration %d on fflush\n", i);
      exit(0);
    }
    fprintf(stderr, "Iteration %d done\n", i);
    i++;
  }
  return 0;
}
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></center><p>

Now, we see that <b>SIGPIPE</b> is indeed generated.  Better yet, when we 
ignore it, the subsequent <b>fflush()</b> fails:

</p><pre>UNIX&gt; <font color="darkred"><b>./sigpipe_2 | head -n 1</b></font>
Iteration 0 done
Iteration 1 done
...
Iteration 2469 done
ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
Ignoring Sigpipe()
Died on iteration 2470 on fflush
UNIX&gt; 
</pre>

(When you run this, you may find that it fails on <b>fputs()</b> instead of <b>fflush()</b>).
<p>
With this information, you should take the following statement as
gospel in your Lab 9:

</p><ul>
<i>When the read end of a pipe or socket goes away, <b>fputs()</b> and <b>fflush()</b> will
not generate <b>SIGPIPE</b> immediately.  The bytes are buffered in the operating system and
will be thrown away eventually.  However, the standard I/O calls will return without error
for a while.  Eventually, they will return with errors and they may or may not 
generate <b>SIGPIPE</b>.  Your best bet is to catch and ignore <b>SIGPIPE</b> and always
test return values for determine when the read end of the pipe has gone away.
</i>
</ul>

Since <b>head</b> is most likely written with the stdio library, it performs buffering too,
so perhaps it's not surprising that <b>SIGPIPE</b> is not generated for many iterations.
However, were the operating system not buffering, the output of <b>sigpipe_2 | head -n 1</b>
would be deterministic (it would always be the same).
<p>
To hammer this home further, check out
<b><a href="http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~jplank/plank/classes/cs360/360/notes/Signals/instaclose.c">instaclose.c</a></b>:

</p><p></p><center><table border="3" cellpadding="3"><tbody><tr><td><pre>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

int main()
{
  close(0);
  sleep(1);
  exit(0);
}
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></center><p>

This does no reading from standard input before closing it.  When we call it, we still get 
nondeterministic output:

</p><pre>UNIX&gt; <font color="darkred"><b>./sigpipe_2 | instaclose</b></font>
Iteration 0 done
...
Iteration 46 done
Ignoring Sigpipe()
Died on iteration 47 on fflush
UNIX&gt; <font color="darkred"><b>./sigpipe_2 | instaclose</b></font>
Ignoring Sigpipe()
Died on iteration 0 on fflush
UNIX&gt; <font color="darkred"><b></b></font>
</pre>

Obviously, the operating system does buffering.

<h3>Of Compilers, Optimization, and the ``volatile'' keyword</h3>

When optimization is enabled in the compiler, it performs quite a bit 
of analysis, turning the program into one that produces equivalent
output, but runs faster.  Sometimes, you have no clue what the optimizer
does, but you should be prepared to be mystified.  Let's go back to
<b><a href="http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~jplank/plank/classes/cs360/360/notes/Signals/sh3.c">sh3.c</a></b>
as an example.  When we run it without optimization, the alarm handler
is executed every second, printing out the value of <b>i</b> and <b>j</b>.

<pre>UNIX&gt; <font color="darkred"><b>./sh3</b></font>
1 second  just passed: j =  398.  i = 804296
2 seconds just passed: j =  804.  i = 487960
3 seconds just passed: j = 1210.  i = 977119
4 seconds just passed: j = 1605.  i = 627513
5 seconds just passed: j = 1997.  i = 468054
UNIX&gt; <font color="darkred"><b></b></font>
</pre>

Let's compile it with optimization and run it, to see what happens:

<pre>UNIX&gt; <font color="darkred"><b>gcc -O3 sh3.c</b></font>
UNIX&gt; <font color="darkred"><b>a.out</b></font>
UNIX&gt; <font color="darkred"><b>time ./a.out</b></font>
0.010u 0.000s 0:00.00 0.0%	0+0k 0+0io 0pf+0w
UNIX&gt; <font color="darkred"><b></b></font>
</pre>

Man, that was fast -- it seems too fast.  Back of the hand: we should be 
iterating 2,000,000,000 times.  At roughtly 2 Ghz, that should be taking
roughly a second, not 0.01 seconds.  Something's amiss.  
<p>
What's going on is that the compiler's analysis has figured out that the
loops don't do anything, so it has deleted them.
</p><p>
Let's make the compiler keep the loops.  How about putting this after the loop:

</p><p></p><center><table border="3" cellpadding="3"><tbody><tr><td><pre>  printf("%d %d\n", j, i);
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></center><p>

</p><pre>UNIX&gt; <font color="darkred"><b>gcc -O3 sh3a.c</b></font>
UNIX&gt; <font color="darkred"><b>time ./a.out</b></font>
2000 1000000
0.010u 0.000s 0:00.00 0.0%	0+0k 0+0io 0pf+0w
UNIX&gt; <font color="darkred"><b></b></font>
</pre>

Dang it!  That's a smart compiler.  Ok -- one more try in 
<b><a href="http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~jplank/plank/classes/cs360/360/notes/Signals/sh3b.c">sh3b.c</a></b>:

<p></p><center><table border="3" cellpadding="3"><tbody><tr><td><pre>int i, j, seconds;

void alarm_handler(int dummy)
{
  seconds++;
  printf("%d second%s just passed: j = %4d.  i = %6d\n", seconds,
     (seconds == 1) ? " " : "s", j, i);
  signal(SIGALRM, alarm_handler);
  alarm(1);
}

int main()
{
  int k;
  seconds = 0;

  signal(SIGALRM, alarm_handler);
  alarm(1);

  for (j = 0; j &lt; 2000; j++) {
    for (i = 0; i &lt; 1000000; i++) k = 1-k;
  }
  printf("%d %d %d\n", j, i, k);
  return 0;

There -- the compiler's not smarter than I am!!!!  But now we have another 
problem -- <b>i</b> and <b>j</b> are zero.  That can't be right.
I won't make you look through the assembler, but what has happened is that
the compiler has cached <b>i</b> and <b>j</b> into registers during <b>main()</b>,
and thus their in-memory values remain 0 and 1 while <b>main()</b> is running.
<p>
The solution to this is rather inelegant.  You need to preface the declarations
of <b>i</b> and <b>j</b> with the keyword <b>volatile</b>.  That's not a natural
keyword to me, but that tells the compiler that it needs to store <b>i</b> and <b>j</b>
in memory because the program's control flow may be weird.  That's done in 
<b><a href="http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~jplank/plank/classes/cs360/360/notes/Signals/sh3c.c">sh3c.c</a></b>:

</p><pre>UNIX&gt; <font color="darkred"><b>gcc -O3 sh3c.c</b></font>
UNIX&gt; <font color="darkred"><b>time ./a.out</b></font>
1 second  just passed: j =  482.  i = 913429
2 seconds just passed: j =  965.  i = 918621
3 seconds just passed: j = 1420.  i = 631626
4 seconds just passed: j = 1902.  i = 823540
2000 1000000 0
4.210u 0.000s 0:04.20 100.2%	0+0k 0+0io 0pf+0w
UNIX&gt; <font color="darkred"><b></b></font>
</pre>

You'll note that the program takes 2.5 times longer to run, since <b>i</b> and <b>j</b>
can't be cached in registers anymore.  
<p>
Remember <b>volatile</b> when you learn <b>setjmp/longjmp</b> -- the same types of
problems can occur.

<h3>sort_compare.c - Alternating selection and insertion sort</h3>

I typically don't get to this in class, but it's here in case you're interested.  The
program <b><a href="http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~jplank/plank/classes/cs360/360/notes/Signals/sort_compare.c">sort_compare.c</a></b> generates two identical
random arrays, and sorts one of them with selection sort, and the other with insertion
sort.  At each main loop, it checks a variable called <b>switch_algorithms</b>, which,
if set, changes the algorithm from insertion to selection, and back again.

<p>
And of course, we use <b>alarm()</b> and an alarm handler to set <b>switch_algorithms</b>
to one every second.  This is what causes the program to change algorithms every second:

</p><p></p><center><table border="3" cellpadding="3"><tbody><tr><td><pre>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

      }
      tmp = array1[best];
      array1[best] = array1[selection_index];
      array1[selection_index] = tmp;

Here it is running -- as anticipated, insertion sort is faster than selection sort!
