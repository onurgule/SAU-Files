<h2>Moving from C++ to C</h2>

This class is taught in C, rather than C++.  The reasoning is as follows:
Because C hides so much
less from you than C++, you have a much easier time figuring out what's 
going on when you run one or more programs.  This will be a little painful,
because you lose so many of the wonderful things about C++ on which you have
grown to rely, like <b>cin</b>, strings, objects with methods, and the standard
template library.  Sorry.  
<p>
These lecture notes detail the parts of C++ that you lose when you migrate
to C, and how you replace them.
</p><p>
You have to use <b>gcc</b> to compile programs in this class.  You <i>cannot</i>
use <b>g++</b>.  Don't give the TA's C++ code and say you didn't know.  You know.
</p><p>
Time to learn C.
</p><hr>
<h2>Header files</h2>
As with C++, you include standard header files with <b>#include</b>.  You include
the file name in less-than/greater-than signs, and you include the <b>.h</b> extension.
Instead of starting your programs with:
<p></p><center><table border="3" cellpadding="3"><tbody><tr><td><pre>#include &lt;iostream&gt;
using namespace std;
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></center><p>
you start them with:
</p><p></p><center><table border="3" cellpadding="3"><tbody><tr><td><pre>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></center><p>
I never liked that "using namespace std" stuff anyway.
</p><hr>
<h2>Comments</h2>

Comments in C are delimited by "/*" and "*/".  The former starts the comment, which 
can span multiple lines, and the latter ends the comment.   (C++ style commenting 
has been added to the C standard, so you can use it, but I don't -- you never know when
you're going to be running on that 1979 VM....)
<hr>

<h2>Bye-bye, cin and cout</h2>

Frankly, this isn't too painful, and will be less so when you learn the fields library.
I'm assuming that you already know <b>printf()</b> from previous classes.  
That handles output.  
For input, we'll focus on three procedures that are defined
in <b>stdio.h</b>: <b>scanf()</b>, <b>fscanf()</b> and <b>fgets()</b>.
However, we're going to focus on them in a later lecture.  For now, we'll be 
writing some non-interactive code.


<hr>
<h2>Types in C</h2>

In C, there are three kinds of types that variables can have -- scalars, 
      aggregates, and pointers.  Half of the game in getting things right
      in C is keeping yourself from being confused about types.  This lecture
      tries to elaborate on this a little.

<h2>Scalar Types</h2>

There are 7 scalar types in C:

<li> <b>char</b>       -- 1 byte
</li><li> <b>short</b>      -- 2 bytes
</li><li> <b>int</b>        -- 4 bytes
</li><li> <b>long</b>       -- 4 or 8 bytes, depending on the system and compiler
</li><li> <b>float</b>      -- 4 bytes
</li><li> <b>double</b>     -- 8 bytes
</li><li> (pointer    -- 4 or 8 bytes, depending on the system and compiler)
<p>
These should all be familiar to you (ok, maybe not a <b>short</b>, but the rest should).  
If you want to verify or use the size of a type in C, you use the macro <b>sizeof()</b>.
For example, <b>sizeof(long)</b> will return either 4 or 8, depending on how big a <b>long</b>
is in your system.
</p><p>
You can declare a scalar variable in 
one of three places:  As a global variable, as a procedure parameter, and 
as a local variable.  For example, look at the program below in 
<a href="http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~jplank/plank/classes/cs360/360/notes/CStuff-1/p1.c"><b>p1.c</b></a>:
</p><p>
(In this and all other lecture notes, you can copy the programs and the
makefile into your own directory, and then compile them by using <b>make</b>.
E.g. to make the program <b>p1</b>, you say ``<b>make p1</b>'').

</p><p></p><center><table border="3" cellpadding="3"><tbody><tr><td><pre>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

int i;

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
  int j;

  j = argc;
  i = j;
  printf("Argc:          %d\n", i);

  j = sizeof(long);
  printf("Sizeof(long):  %d\n", j);

  j = sizeof(int *);
  printf("Sizeof(int *): %d\n", j);

  exit(0);
}
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></center><p>

There are three scalar int variables here -- <b>i</b>, <b>j</b>, and 
<b>argc</b>.  <b>I</b> is a global 
variable.  <b>J</b> is a local variable, and <b>argc</b> 
is a parameter.  Scalars are 
pretty straightforward.   You can pass them as parameters to procedures, and 
return them from procedures without worrying about anything going awry.  

The program prints argc (which it has copied to the variables j and i), and then
the size of longs and pointers.  Here are two runs on my Mac (in 2018).  As 
you can see, longs and pointers are 8 bytes:

</p><pre>UNIX&gt; <font color="darkred"><b>./p1</b></font>
Argc:          1
Sizeof(long):  8
Sizeof(int *): 8
UNIX&gt; <font color="darkred"><b>./p1 using many arguments</b></font>
Argc:          4
Sizeof(long):  8
Sizeof(int *): 8
UNIX&gt; <font color="darkred"><b></b></font>
</pre>

Some machines allow you to compile in 32-bit mode, which forces pointers and longs to 
be four bytes.  On my macintosh, that's the "-m32" option to <b>gcc</b>:

<pre>UNIX&gt; <font color="darkred"><b>gcc -m32 -o p1-32 p1.c</b></font>
UNIX&gt; <font color="darkred"><b>./p1-32</b></font>
Argc:          1
Sizeof(long):  4
Sizeof(int *): 4
UNIX&gt; <font color="darkred"><b></b></font>
</pre>

Some machines don't have 8-byte longs or pointers.  One example is the Raspberry Pi.
When I pulled the repo and compiled on my Pi, I got the following:

<pre>pi@raspberrypi:~/CS360/cs360-lecture-notes/Cstuff-1$ <font color="darkred"><b>./p1</b></font>
Argc:          1
Sizeof(long):  4
Sizeof(int *): 4
pi@raspberrypi:~/CS360/cs360-lecture-notes/Cstuff-1$ 
</pre>

The Pi's compiler doesn't have the "-m32" option.  Such is life.

<hr>
<h2>Aggregate Types</h2>

Arrays and structs are aggregate types in C.  They are more complex than 
scalars.  You can statically declare an array as a global or local variable --
I do both below in 
<b><a href="http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~jplank/plank/classes/cs360/360/notes/CStuff-1/p2.c">p2.c</a></b>:

<p></p><center><table border="3" cellpadding="3"><tbody><tr><td><pre>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

char s1[15];

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
  char s2[4];

...
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></center><p>
<b>S1</b> is a global array of 15 chars and 
<b>s2</b> is a local array of 4 chars.  
</p><p>
If an array has been statically declared, then you cannot assign it to 
another array.  For example, look at the rest of <a href="http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~jplank/plank/classes/cs360/360/notes/CStuff-1/p2.c"><b>p2.c</b></a>:

</p><p></p><center><table border="3" cellpadding="3"><tbody><tr><td><pre>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

char s1[15];

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
  char s2[4];
  
  s2 = "Jim";
  exit(0);
}
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></center><p>

The statement ``<b>s2 = "Jim"</b>'' is illegal in C, because <b>s2</b> has 
been statically 
declared.  If you try to compile this program, <b>gcc</b> 
will give you an error:
</p><pre>UNIX&gt; <font color="darkred"><b>gcc -o p2 p2.c</b></font>
p2.c: In function `main':
p2.c:10: incompatible types in assignment
UNIX&gt;
</pre>
This is a good rule to bear in mind -- if <b>x</b> 
is an array, then you should <i>NEVER</i> say 
``<b>x = <i>something</i></b>''.  It
will usually give you an error.  However, if it doesn't (because they change
the compiler yet again), you are writing bad C code.
<p>
However, you can always say ``<b><i>something</i> = x</b>''.  We'll discuss later in the 
lecture.
</p><p>

When you pass arrays as parameters, the pointers are passed, and not the arrays.  
This is unlike a vector in C++, which copies the vectors.  Here's an example
(in <b><a href="http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~jplank/plank/classes/cs360/360/notes/CStuff-1/p2a.c">p2a.c</a></b>):

</p><p></p><center><table border="3" cellpadding="3"><tbody><tr><td><pre>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

<font color="blue">/* This sets any lower-case letter in a to upper case. */</font>

void change_case(char a[20])
{
  int i;

  for (i = 0; a[i] != '\0'; i++) {
    if (a[i] &gt;= 'a' &amp;&amp; a[i] &lt;= 'z') a[i] += ('A' - 'a');
  }
}

<font color="blue">/* This sets a string to 19 characters and then calls change_case(). */</font>

int main()
{
  int i;
  char s[20];
  
  <font color="blue">/* Set s to "abcdefghijklmnopqrs". */</font>

  for (i = 0; i &lt; 19; i++) s[i] = 'a' + i;
  s[19] = '\0';

  printf("First, S is %s.\n", s);
  change_case(s);
  printf("Now, S is   %s.\n", s);

  return 0;
}
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></center><p>

You'll note that even though you declare <b>a</b> to be an array of 20 chars, it is simply
the pointer that gets passed to the procedure.  For that reason, <b>change_case()</b> operates
on the array, and not on a copy:

</p><pre>UNIX&gt; <font color="darkred"><b>./p2a</b></font>
First, S is abcdefghijklmnopqrs.
Now, S is   ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRS.
UNIX&gt;
</pre>

In fact, you can't trust that the compiler cares about the fact you put the "20" inside
the declaration of <b>change_case</b>.  The following are in fact all equivalent:

<pre>void change_case(char a[20])
void change_case(char a[19])
void change_case(char a[5000])
void change_case(char a[])
void change_case(char *a)
</pre>

<hr>
<h3>Structs</h3>

The second way to aggregate data is with a <b>struct</b>.  A <b>struct</b> looks a little
like a C++ class with some notable omissions:
<ul>
<li> No "public/protected/private" mess.
</li><li> No constructors/destructors.
</li><li> No default "copy" methods or any of that mess.
</li><li> No methods.
</li></ul>

Suppose we want to aggregate an int and a double.  We can do that as in 
<b><a href="http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~jplank/plank/classes/cs360/360/notes/CStuff-1/id1.c">id1.c</a></b>

<p></p><center><table border="3" cellpadding="3"><tbody><tr><td><pre>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

struct intdouble {
  int i;
  double d;
};

int main()
{
  struct intdouble id1;

  id1.i = 5;
  id1.d = 3.14;

  printf("%d %.2lf\n", id1.i, id1.d);
  exit(0);
}
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></center><p>


</p><pre>UNIX&gt; <font color="darkred"><b>./id1</b></font>
5 3.14
UNIX&gt; <font color="darkred"><b></b></font>
</pre>

You can use a <b>typedef</b> to make it a little more readable (<b><a href="http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~jplank/plank/classes/cs360/360/notes/CStuff-1/id2.c">id2.c</a></b>):

<p></p><center><table border="3" cellpadding="3"><tbody><tr><td><pre>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

typedef struct intdouble {
  int i;
  double d;
} ID;

int main()
{
  ID id1;

  id1.i = 5;
  id1.d = 3.14;

  printf("1: %d %.2lf\n", id1.i, id1.d);
  exit(0);
}
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></center><p>

You may have some confusion with structs, because they exist in C++ with different
semantics.  Let's take a look at the following code in C++, which declares two
<b>intdouble</b>'s, sets one's variables, and then copies one to the other (<b><a href="http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~jplank/plank/classes/cs360/360/notes/CStuff-1/id3.cpp">id3.cpp</a></b>):

</p><p></p><center><table border="3" cellpadding="3"><tbody><tr><td><pre>#include &lt;cstdio&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
using namespace std;

struct intdouble {
  int i;
  double d;
};

int main()
{
  intdouble id1, id2;

  id1.i = 5;
  id1.d = 3.14;

  id2 = id1;
  id2.i += 5;
  id2.d += 5;

  printf("1: %d %.2lf\n", id1.i, id1.d);
  printf("2: %d %.2lf\n", id2.i, id2.d);
}
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></center><p>

Straightforward when it runs:

</p><pre>UNIX&gt; <font color="darkred"><b>./id3</b></font>
1: 5 3.14
2: 10 8.14
UNIX&gt; <font color="darkred"><b></b></font>
</pre>


Let's change this to C.  If we simply fix the headers, this will not compile.
That is because C++ creates 
"intdouble" as a type, and C does not.  When we try to compile, it fails:

<pre>UNIX&gt; <font color="darkred"><b>gcc -o id4 id4.c</b></font>
id4.c: In function 'main':
id4.c:11: error: 'intdouble' undeclared (first use in this function)
id4.c:11: error: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once
id4.c:11: error: for each function it appears in.)
id4.c:11: error: expected ';' before 'id1'
id4.c:13: error: 'id1' undeclared (first use in this function)
id4.c:16: error: 'id2' undeclared (first use in this function)
UNIX&gt; <font color="darkred"><b></b></font>
</pre>

Now, if you put "struct" in front of "intdouble," that will fix the 
problem.  It is in
<b><a href="http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~jplank/plank/classes/cs360/360/notes/CStuff-1/id5.c">id5.c</a></b>:

<p></p><center><table border="3" cellpadding="3"><tbody><tr><td><pre>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

struct intdouble {
  int i;
  double d;
};

int main()
{
  struct intdouble id1, id2;

  id1.i = 5;
  id1.d = 3.14;

  id2 = id1;  <font color="blue">/* THIS IS THE OFFENDING LINE */</font>
  id2.i += 5;
  id2.d += 5;

  printf("1: %d %.2lf\n", id1.i, id1.d);
  printf("2: %d %.2lf\n", id2.i, id2.d);
  exit(0);
}
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></center><p>

This runs identically to the C++ version.  I can tell you that I disapprove of 
this code.  Why? Because the statement ``<b>id2 = id1</b>'' offends me.  It is the 
only part of C where you can copy an unspecified number of bytes with an assignment
statement.  It is a weakness of the language.  For example, take a look at
<b><a href="http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~jplank/plank/classes/cs360/360/notes/CStuff-1/id5a.c">id5a.c</a></b>:

</p><p></p><center><table border="3" cellpadding="3"><tbody><tr><td><pre>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

typedef struct {
  int a[1000];
} SID;

int main()
{
  SID s1, s2;
  int i;

  for (i = 0; i &lt; 1000; i++) s1.a[i] = i;
  s2 = s1;

  for (i = 0; i &lt; 1000; i++) printf("%4d %4d\n", s1.a[i], s2.a[i]);
 
  exit(0);
}
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></center><p>

The ``<b>s2 = s1</b>'' line copies 4000 bytes.  While I expect such garbage in C++,
I am surprised that it's legal in C.  Why does it allow you to copy the struct, but
not to copy the array?  Who knows -- anyway, I want you to be aware of it.
You will never see me use that feature of the language because I don't approve.

As a corollary, you can pass a struct as an argument to a procedure, and in C++
fashion, it makes a copy of the entire thing.  You'll note that in 
<b><a href="http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~jplank/plank/classes/cs360/360/notes/CStuff-1/id5b.c">id5b.c</a></b>, I define a procedure <b>a()</b>, which changes the
last element of the array, and when we run it, <b>s1.a[999]</b> is unchanged.  
Make a mental note of it.

</p><p></p><center><table border="3" cellpadding="3"><tbody><tr><td><pre>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

typedef struct {
  int a[1000];

{                <font color="blue">/* s is a copy of the calling parameter, so it is    */</font>
  s.a[999] = -1; <font color="blue">/* deleted at the end of the procedure.              */</font>
}                <font color="blue">/* In other words, the procedure does nothing.       */</font>


int main()
{
  SID s1, s2;
  int i;

  for (i = 0; i &lt; 1000; i++) s1.a[i] = i;
  s2 = s1;

  a(s1);
  for (i = 0; i &lt; 1000; i++) printf("%4d %4d\n", s1.a[i], s2.a[i]);
 
  exit(0);
}

<p>
A final note about C++ structs.  They are basically stripped down classes -- you 
can put methods in them, and then implement the methods using the struct's variables,
as in <b><a href="http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~jplank/plank/classes/cs360/360/notes/CStuff-1/id6.cpp">id6.cpp</a></b>:

</p><p></p><center><table border="3" cellpadding="3"><tbody><tr><td valign="top"><pre>#include &lt;cstdio&gt;

struct intdouble {
  int i;

  void Print();
};

{
  printf("   %d %.2lf\n", i, d);
}
</pre></td><td valign="top"><pre>int main()

  intdouble id1, id2;

  id1.i = 5;
  id1.d = 3.14;

  id2 = id1;
  id2.i += 5;
  id2.d += 5;

  id1.Print();
  id2.Print();
}
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></center><p>

Whoever designed structs in C++ did the world a disservice, because you have the same
constructs in two fairly similar languages that have completely different semantics.
Which means that tons of people are going to be confused going from C++ to C, or 
even C to C++ when their struct semantics are off.  It is for this reason that
I don't teach structs as a C++ construct in either CS140 or CS302.  Just use
a class.  
</p><p>
<i>(When your job interviewer asks you why you are using classes rather than 
structs in C++, you should respond as follows: "Structs in C++ are totally different
constructs than they are in C.  However, they have enough similarity that one can
easily get confused when writing code in both languages.  For that reason, I choose
to use structs in C, but not in C++.  In C++, I use a class.  The compiler should
be smart enough to make the class code as efficient as struct code.")</i>
