<b>Caveat from 2001</b>:
<i>Read the lecture before trying these programs.  
Unfortunately, the implementation of 
<b>malloc()</b> and <b>free()</b> on our lab machines
will not match the description in these notes 100 percent.
That is because these notes were originally written in the 
mid-1990's and malloc implementations seem to change every
few years.
</i><p><i>
I stick with this description because it is clear.  
However, it is not how things really work these days.</i>
</p><hr>
<b>Caveat from 2014</b>:
<font color="darkred">Also, <b>sbrk()</b> and <b>brk()</b> are no longer used to 
implement <b>malloc()</b>.  Instead, the system call is <b>mmap()</b>.  I don't think
the complexities of <b>mmap()</b> are worth exploring in CS360.  You may want to explore
them on your own.  The first important thing is for you to realize that <b>malloc()</b> is a
buffered interface on top of a system call that allows the operating system to give
you memory.  In these lectures, that system call is <b>sbrk()</b>, although in reality
it is <b>mmap()</b>.
<p>
If you compile this code to run it, you may get a pack of warnings about <b>sbrk()</b>
being deprecated.  Ignore them.  
</p></font><p><font color="darkred">
The second important thing is that <b>malloc()</b> has to do bookkeeping somehow, and one
way to do that is to use the bytes before the pointer that it returns.  That is the topic
of this lecture.</font>

</p><hr>

This is a lecture about <b>sbrk()</b> and <b>malloc()</b>.

<p>Last class we went over some general memory stuff
-- we learned that the last address in the code
segment is <b>&amp;etext</b>, and the last address in
the globals segment is <b>&amp;end</b>.  
As the program runs, and
memory is allocated from the heap using <b>malloc()</b>,
the heap grows. To figure out the boundary of the
heap, we must use <b>brk()</b> or <b>sbrk()</b>.  Both are
system calls, and you can read their man pages.
We will only discuss <b>sbrk()</b> as it is the only
call you will need.  

</p><pre>caddr_t sbrk(int incr);
</pre>

A <b>caddr_t</b> is a "c address pointer".  It is the same as a 
<b>(char *)</b> or a <b>(void *)</b>.

<p>This specifies for the operating system to
give <b>incr</b> more bytes to the heap.  It returns a
pointer to the end of the heap before <b>sbrk()</b> was
called.  Thus, the new end of the heap after an
<b>sbrk()</b> call is at address 

</p><pre>    sbrk(incr) + incr;
</pre>

If you call <b>sbrk(0)</b>, then it returns the current end of the heap.

<p>Now, <b>malloc()</b> (and the related programs
<b>realloc()</b> and <b>calloc()</b>) all call <b>sbrk()</b> to get
the memory to allocate in the heap.  They are the
only routines that call <b>sbrk()</b>.  Thus, the only
way that you can get memory in the heap is
through <b>malloc()</b> or <b>sbrk()</b>.  However, you should
use <b>malloc()</b>, as it is more efficient. 

</p><hr>
Let's try it out.  Look at
<a href="http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~jplank/plank/classes/cs360/360/notes/Malloc1/fb2.c"><b>fb2.c</b></a>: 

<p></p><center><table border="3" cellpadding="3"><tbody><tr><td><pre>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;

int main()
{
  int *i1, *i2;

  printf("sbrk(0) before malloc(4): 0x%x\n", sbrk(0));

  i1 = (int *) malloc(4);
  printf("sbrk(0) after `i1 = (int *) malloc(4)': 0x%x\n", sbrk(0));

  i2 = (int *) malloc(4);
  printf("sbrk(0) after `i2 = (int *) malloc(4)': 0x%x\n", sbrk(0));

  printf("i1 = 0x%x, i2 = 0x%x\n", (unsigned int) i1, (unsigned int) i2);
}
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></center><p>

This prints <b>sbrk(0)</b> before and after some <b>malloc()</b> 
calls.  Here's the result of running it on a Linux box in 2014:

</p><pre>UNIX&gt; <font color="darkred"><b>fb2</b></font>
sbrk(0) before malloc(4): 0x21ab0
sbrk(0) after `i1 = (int *) malloc(4)': 0x23ab0
sbrk(0) after `i2 = (int *) malloc(4)': 0x23ab0
i1 = 0x21ac0, i2 = 0x21ad0
UNIX&gt;
</pre>

As you can see, the first <b>malloc()</b> call changed the return value
of <b>sbrk(0)</b>.  The second one did not.  You'll also note that the
difference between the first two <b>sbrk(0)</b> calls is 
<p>
</p><center><tt>(0x23ab0 - 0x21ab0 = 0x2000 = 8K)</tt></center><p>

This number will be different from system to system.  On my Raspberry Pi 
in 2018, it was 33K.  However
all systems will share one feature: The number is a lot bigger than the four bytes that
we asked for.  The reason it does that is buffering.  Since <b>sbrk()</b> is a
system call, it is expensive.  By calling it with a large number, <b>malloc()</b>
can satisfy a lot of requests for smaller blocks of memory with just one system
call to <b>sbrk()</b>.
</p><p>

To repeat -- <b>malloc()</b> calls <b>sbrk()</b> with a large number which it
treats as a buffer.  Then it doles out memory from this buffer. 
After <b>i1</b> and <b>i2</b> are allocated, there
is still a whole bunch of memory -- from <tt>0x0x21ad0</tt>
to <tt>0x0x23ab0</tt> that <b>malloc()</b> can use before calling
<b>sbrk()</b> again.  This is roughly 8160 bytes.
Thus, in <a href="http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~jplank/plank/classes/cs360/360/notes/Malloc1/fb2a.c"><b>fb2a.c</b></a>,
when we
do a <b>malloc(8164)</b> after allocating <b>i1</b> and <b>i2</b>, we
expect to see that <b>sbrk()</b> was called to get more
memory, and indeed this is the case: 

</p><pre>UNIX&gt; <font color="darkred"><b>./fb2a</b></font>
sbrk(0) before malloc(4): 0x21b68
sbrk(0) after `i1 = (int *) malloc(4)': 0x23b68
sbrk(0) after `i2 = (int *) malloc(4)': 0x23b68
i1 = 0x21b78, i2 = 0x21b88, sbrk(0)-i2 = 8160
sbrk(0) after `i3 = (int *) malloc(8164)': 0x25b68
i3 = 0x21f78
UNIX&gt;
</pre>

Now, look at 
<a href="http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~jplank/plank/classes/cs360/360/notes/Malloc1/fb3.c"><b>fb3.c</b></a>.
This calls <b>malloc(4)</b> 10 times and prints out the
memory allocated:

<b><a href="http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~jplank/plank/classes/cs360/360/notes/Malloc1/fb3.c">fb3.c</a></b>

<p></p><center><table border="3" cellpadding="3"><tbody><tr><td><pre>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

int main()
{
  int j, *buf;

  for (j = 0; j &lt; 10; j++) {
    buf = (int *) malloc(4);
    printf("malloc(4) returned 0x%x\n", (unsigned int) buf);
  }
  return 0;
}
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></center><p>

</p><pre>UNIX&gt; <font color="darkred"><b>./fb3</b></font>
malloc(4) returned 0x219d0
malloc(4) returned 0x219e0
malloc(4) returned 0x219f0
malloc(4) returned 0x21a00
malloc(4) returned 0x21a10
malloc(4) returned 0x21a20
malloc(4) returned 0x21a30
malloc(4) returned 0x21a40
malloc(4) returned 0x21a50
malloc(4) returned 0x21a60
UNIX&gt;
</pre>

You'll note that each return value from <b>malloc()</b> is
16 bytes greater than the previous one.  You
might expect it to be only 4 bytes greater since
it is only allocating 4 bytes.  What is happening
is that <b>malloc()</b> allocates some extra bytes each
time it is called so that it can do bookkeeping.
These extra bytes help out when <b>free()</b> is
called.  These extra bytes are often allocated
<i>before</i> the returned memory.  You'll see
why when we start to look at <b>free()</b>.

<p>
Look at 
<a href="http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~jplank/plank/classes/cs360/360/notes/Malloc1/fb4.c"><b>fb4.c</b></a>.
What this does is allocate a whole bunch
of memory regions using <b>malloc()</b>, and then it
prints out their starting addresses, and the
values that are located one and two integers 
before the starting addresses.  Again, this is the kind of code which 
(for good reason) most programmers deem as ``unsafe''.
However, it's the only way to check out these things.
As you can see, two integers before the
return value from <b>malloc()</b> contains how many bytes
were actually allocated.  This is a little
confusing, so lets look at the output of <b>fb4</b> in
detail:  (Again, on different systems, <b>malloc()</b> works in different
ways.  I illustrate some examples in
<a href="http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~jplank/plank/classes/cs360/360/notes/Malloc1/diff.html">this note</a>).

</p><pre>UNIX&gt; <font color="darkred"><b>./fb4</b></font>
sbrk(0) = 0x61a0
Allocated 4 bytes.  buf = 0x61a8, buf[-1] = 0, buf[-2] = 16, buf[0] = 1000
Allocated 8 bytes.  buf = 0x61b8, buf[-1] = 0, buf[-2] = 16, buf[0] = 1001
Allocated 12 bytes.  buf = 0x61c8, buf[-1] = 0, buf[-2] = 24, buf[0] = 1002
Allocated 16 bytes.  buf = 0x61e0, buf[-1] = 0, buf[-2] = 24, buf[0] = 1003
Allocated 20 bytes.  buf = 0x61f8, buf[-1] = 0, buf[-2] = 32, buf[0] = 1004
Allocated 24 bytes.  buf = 0x6218, buf[-1] = 0, buf[-2] = 32, buf[0] = 1005
Allocated 28 bytes.  buf = 0x6238, buf[-1] = 0, buf[-2] = 40, buf[0] = 1006
Allocated 100 bytes.  buf = 0x6260, buf[-1] = 0, buf[-2] = 112, buf[0] = 1007
sbrk(0) = 0x70f8
UNIX&gt;
</pre>

So, look at the heap after the first call to <b>malloc()</b>, and <b>buf[0]</b> 
is set to <b>i</b> = 1000:

<pre>         |---------------|  
         |      ...      | 
         |               |      
         |      16       | 0x61a0
         |               | 0x61a4     
         |     1000      | 0x61a8  &lt;--------- return value
         |               | 0x61ac
         |               | 0x61b0
         |               | 0x61b4
         |      ...      |      
         |               |      
         |               |      
         |               |      
         |---------------| 0x70f8 (sbrk(0));
</pre>

When <b>malloc()</b> is called a second time (<b>buf = malloc(8)</b>), 
<b>malloc()</b>
returns <b>0x61b8</b>.  After <b>buf[0]</b> is set to <b>i</b> = 1001, 
the heap looks as
follows:
<pre>         |---------------|  
         |      ...      | 
         |               |      
         |      16       | 0x61a0
         |               | 0x61a4     
         |     1000      | 0x61a8  
         |               | 0x61ac
         |      16       | 0x61b0
         |               | 0x61b4
         |     1001      | 0x61b8  &lt;--------- return value
         |               | 0x61bc
         |               | 0x61c0
         |               | 0x61c4
         |      ...      |      
         |               |      
         |               |      
         |---------------| 0x70f8 (sbrk(0));
</pre>

And so on -- when the final <b>sbrk(0)</b> is called, the heap looks as follows:

<pre>         |---------------| 
         |      ...      |
         |               | 
         |      16       | 0x61a0
         |               | 0x61a4
         |     1000      | 0x61a8
         |               | 0x61ac
         |      16       | 0x61b0
         |               | 0x61b4
         |     1001      | 0x61b8 
         |               | 0x61bc
         |      24       | 0x61c0

Once again, <b>malloc()</b> calls <b>sbrk()</b> to get memory from the
operating system into a buffer, and then it doles
out the memory from that buffer as it is called.
When it runs out of buffer space, it calls <b>sbrk()</b>
to get more. 

<p>Why do <b>malloc(4)</b> and <b>malloc(8)</b> allocate 16 bytes,
and <b>malloc(12)</b> and <b>malloc(16)</b> allocate 24?
Because <b>malloc()</b> pads out the memory allocated to
multiples of 8 bytes.  Thus <b>malloc(4)</b> and
<b>malloc(8)</b> allocate 8 bytes for the user, plus an
extra 8 bytes for bookkeeping.  <b>Malloc(12)</b> and
<b>malloc(16)</b> allocate 16 bytes for the user, plus
an extra 8 bytes for bookkeeping for a total of
24 bytes.  <b>Malloc(100)</b> allocates 104 bytes for
the user, plus an extra 8 bytes for bookkeeping. 

</p><p>Why does <b>malloc()</b> perform this padding?  So that
the addresses returned will be multiples of eight, and
thus will be valid for pointers of any type.  Suppose
<b>malloc()</b> didn't do this, and instead could return any
pointer.  Then if you did the following:
</p><pre>  int *i;

  i = (int *) malloc(4);
  *i = 4;
</pre>
you might generate a bus error, because <b>malloc()</b> may return
a value that is not a multiple of 4.  As it is, <b>malloc()</b>
returns multiples of eight, so that pointers to doubles
and long integers will not cause bus errors.

<p>How does <b>malloc()</b> know where to dole memory from?
It uses a global variable or two.  For example,
it may have two global variables defined as
follows: 

</p><pre>char *malloc_begin = NULL;
char *malloc_end = NULL;
</pre>

When <b>malloc()</b> is called, it first checks to
see if <b>malloc_begin</b> equals <b>NULL</b>.  If so, it calls
<b>sbrk()</b> to get a buffer.  It uses <b>malloc_begin</b> and
<b>malloc_end</b> to denote the beginning and end of
that buffer.  As <b>malloc()</b> gets called further, it doles
out memory from the beginning of the buffer, and updates
<b>malloc_begin</b> accordingly.  If there is not enough
room in the buffer, then <b>sbrk()</b> is called to get
more buffer space, and <b>malloc_end</b> is incremented
to denote the enlarged buffer.

<p>Now, this describes how to write a simple <b>malloc()</b>
with no <b>free()</b> calls.  When <b>free()</b> gets called,
you should have <b>malloc()</b> be able to reuse that memory.  This
means that you have to do something more
sophisticated with <b>malloc()</b>.  We'll talk about it
in Malloc lecture #2.  Think about it in the
meantime.
