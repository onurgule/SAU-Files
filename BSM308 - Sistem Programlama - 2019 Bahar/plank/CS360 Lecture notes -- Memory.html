<h1> Before I Start </h1>

(This was written in 2018.)
This lecture material can be problematic, because memory layout, and the primitives
used to explore them are typically not POSIX standards, and can differ from operating
system to operating system.  Fortunately, the concepts are easy to map from one machine to
another, but I can understand your frustration if things become confusing on a new machine.
<p>
Also fortunately, Raspberry Pi's using the Raspbian operating system are pretty clean, 32-bit
machines.  The output that you see below will be on a Pi, so if you have access
to one and want to follow along, then please do so.  Most Linux OS's will come close to
what you see here, so long as you are ready for 64-bit pointers.  If you compile these
programs with <b>-m32</b> on a 64-bit Linux machine, you'll get nicer looking pointers.
</p><p>
(Also, if you compile these with a strict compiler, you'll get warnings.  Sorry, but
I don't want to junk up my code with the proper typecasts to get rid of the warnings.
They don't happen on the Pi).

<h1> Memory </h1>

This lecture is an introduction to memory as we see it in Unix.
<p>
</p><p>As I have said previously, memory is like a huge array with 
2<sup>32</sup> or 2<sup>64</sup> elements, depending on whether you are 
running in 32 or 64-bit mode.
A pointer in C is an index to this array.  Thus when 
a C pointer is <tt>0xefffe034</tt>, it points to the <tt>0xefffe035th</tt> element in 
the memory array (memory being indexed starting with zero).

</p><p>You cannot access all elements of memory.  One example
that we have seen a lot is element 0.  If you try to dereference a 
pointer with a value of 0, you will get a segmentation violation.
This is Unix's way of telling you that that memory location is
illegal.

</p><p>For example, the following program 
(<b><a href="http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~jplank/plank/classes/cs360/360/notes/Memory/segfault.c">segfault.c</a></b>)
will generate a segmentation violation.

</p><p></p><center><table border="3" cellpadding="3"><tbody><tr><td><pre>int main()
{
  char *s;
  char c;

  s = (char *) 0;
  c = *s;           <font color="blue">/* The segmentation violation happens here. */</font>
  return 0;
}
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></center><p>

</pre>

There are many regions of memory that are set up to be legal, when you run your
program.  They are set up by the operating system, with the help of the hardware.
I will talk about four of them here.  While there are standard Unix names for 
them (which I'll tell you), I think that they are confusing, so I use my own:
<ol>
<li><b>The code</b>: This memory region holds the instructions of your program.
The standard Unix name for this is "text".
</li><li><b>The globals</b>: These are your global variables.  Standard Unix lingo splits the
globals into two parts: "Data", which holds global variables that have been initialized in
the program; and "BSS", which holds global variables that have not been initialized.
</li><li><b>The heap</b>: This is memory that you get from <b>malloc()</b> (or <b>new</b> in C++).
</li><li><b>The stack</b>: This contains your local variables and procedure arguments.
</li></ol>

If we view memory as a big array, the regions (or ``segments'') look
as follows:

<pre>     |--------------| 0x00000000
     |              |
     |   void       |
     |              |
     |--------------| 
     |              |
     |  code        |
     |              |
     |--------------|
     |  void        |
     |--------------| 
     |              |
     |  globals     |
     |              |
     |--------------|
     |  void        |
     |--------------|
     |              |
     |  heap        |
     |              |  You can make the heap grow with the sbrk() or mmap() system call.
     |--------------|
     |  void        |
     |--------------|
     |              |
     |  stack       |
     |              | 
     |--------------|
     |  void        |
     |--------------| 0xffffffff
</pre>

Note, the heap grows down as you make more <b>malloc()</b> calls and your program
asks the operating system for more memory.  As we have seen in the Assembly code
lecture notes, the stack grows "upward", by subtracting values from the stack and frame
pointers.  In reality, the stack is a fixed size (typically 8 MB).  You could make it
grow by using <b>mmap()</b> properly, but that is not what happens by default.

<hr>
<h1>Paging</h1>

On all machines, memory is broken up into fixed chunks called pages.
Pages are typically 4096 or 8192 bytes long, but other sizes have been supported
by other machines.  You can find out your machine's page size by calling
the <b>getpagesize()</b> system call.  On the Pi, they are 4096 bytes (we
will see this below).

<p>
The way memory works is as follows:  The operating system allocates
certain pages of memory for you.  Whenever you try to read, write or execute
an instruction 
from an address in memory, the hardware first checks with the operating
system to see if that address belongs to a page that has been allocated
for you, and if you have permission to do the operation.  
If so, then it goes ahead and performs the read/write.  If
not, you'll get a segmentation violation, which is a hardware error.  It is caught
by the operating system, which in turn "sends" it to your program (we'll see how
you can "catch" it later in the semester).

</p><p>This is what happens when you do:

</p><pre>  s = (char *) 0;
  c = *s;
</pre>

When you say "<b>c = *s</b>", the hardware sees that you
want to read memory location zero.  The hardware checks a table, which has been set up
by the operating system, to see if location zero is legal, and discovers that it
is not.  This results in a segmentation violation.  

<p>The exact mechanics of paging are covered in
classes on Operating Systems.  I won't go into them
further here.  What you should understand is that the hardware and operating system
manage memory at a page granularity, and that when you want to use memory, to read it, 
write it, or execute instructions from it, the hardware checks the page on which the
memory resides, to make sure you have the permissions to use it.  If you don't, you'll
get a segmentation violation.

<h1>Looking at Memory Regions of your Program</h1>

The program 
<b><a href="http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~jplank/plank/classes/cs360/360/notes/Memory/look_at_memory.c">look_at_memory.c</a></b>
takes a look at the various memory regions of your program, while it is running.

<p></p><center><table border="3" cellpadding="3"><tbody><tr><td valign="top"><pre>#include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;

Again, not all machines will allow this code to compile.  Linux-based machines are a pretty
safe bet, though.  Go ahead and read the comments to the code above.  Basically, we are 
printing out addresses of variables in each of the memory segments that I describe above.
After that, we look at the file <b>/proc/<i>pid</i>/maps</b>, which lets you know
about the memory mappings in the process with id <i>pid</i>.  

</p><p>
We run the program on a Raspberry Pi, and we get a lot of information:

From this program, we can deduce that our program's address space looks as in the picture below:

<p></p><center><table border="3"><tbody><tr><td><img src="./CS360 Lecture notes -- Memory_files/Drawings.jpg"></td></tr></tbody></table></center><p>

You'll note that every memory address from <tt>0x0</tt> to <tt>0xffffffff</tt> is accounted
for.  You'll also note how the <b>printf()</b> statements from the program match the 
picture.  For example, <b>A</b> and <b>B</b> have values between <tt>0x20000</tt>
(the beginning of the globals) and <tt>0x20ffff</tt> (the end of the globals).  
They also have values lower than
<b>&amp;edata</b>, which is right, because they are initialized by the program.
</p><p>
<b>X</b> and <b>Y</b> also have values between <tt>0x20000</tt>
and <tt>0x20ffff</tt>.  They are uninitialized, so they belong in the "bss" segment.
Accordingly, their values are between <b>&amp;edata</b> and 
<b>&amp;end</b>.
</p><p>
You should also see that <b>main</b> and <b>proc_a</b> are in the code segment, 
<b>buf</b> is in the heap, and <b>&amp;i</b>, <b>&amp;buf</b> and <b>&amp;argc</b> are
all in the stack segment.  
</p><p>
All of the addresses labeled <b>NULL</b> will give you segmentation violations if you 
try to access them.
</p><p>
It is slightly unfortunate that the heap addresses
and stack addresses will change from run to run:

</p><pre>UNIX&gt; <font color="darkred"><b>./look_at_memory | grep buf</b></font>
buf: 0x53b008
&amp;buf:  0x7e98eb38
UNIX&gt; <font color="darkred"><b>./look_at_memory | grep buf</b></font>
buf: 0x1274008
&amp;buf:  0x7efc4b38
UNIX&gt; <font color="darkred"><b>./look_at_memory | grep buf</b></font>
buf: 0x19df008
&amp;buf:  0x7eec7b38
UNIX&gt; <font color="darkred"><b></b></font>
</pre>

The reason for this is security.  Be ready for it.

<h3>Reading, Writing and Executing Memory Regions</h3>

The program 
<b><a href="http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~jplank/plank/classes/cs360/360/notes/Memory/mess_with_memory.c">mess_with_memory.c</a></b> changes
<b><a href="http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~jplank/plank/classes/cs360/360/notes/Memory/look_at_memory.c">look_at_memory.c</a></b> in a few minor ways.
First, it defines the procedure <b>proc_a</b> to simply print "Hi":

<p></p><center><table border="3" cellpadding="3"><tbody><tr><td><pre>void proc_a()
{
  printf("Hi\n");
}
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></center><p>

Next, it defines three more variables in <b>main()</b>.  These are <b>ptr</b>, 
<b>c</b> and <b>proc</b>:
</p><p></p><center><table border="3" cellpadding="3"><tbody><tr><td><pre>  char *ptr;
  char c;
  void (*proc)();
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></center><p>

The only subtle one is <b>proc</b> -- it is a pointer to a function, which you 
can set and execute at runtime.  
</p><p>
At the end of <b>mess_with_memory</b>, we do some dangerous stuff.  In fact, if 
you have ever heard someone say that C is a dangerous or unsafe language, well
here's your proof!  Read the comments to see what the code is doing.

</p><p></p><center><table border="3" cellpadding="3"><tbody><tr><td><pre>
  <font color="blue">/* All the previous code from look_at_memory.c is here. */</font>

  i = 0xabcd;

  while (1) {
    printf("\n");
    printf("Enter an address (with 0x), and R|W|X: ");
    fflush(stdout);
  
    <font color="blue">/* From stdin, read a pointer value into ptr, and a character R, W, or X into c. */</font>

    if (scanf("0x%x %c", &amp;ptr, &amp;c) != 2 || strchr("RWX", c) == NULL) {
      printf("Exiting\n");
      exit(0);
    }
  
    <font color="blue">/* If c is 'R', read the character at the pointer. */</font>

    if (c == 'R') {
      printf("Reading 0x%x\n", (UI) ptr);
      fflush(stdout);
      c = *ptr;
      printf("Read 0x%x\n", c); 
  
    <font color="blue">/* If c is 'W', write the value 0x67 to the byte at the pointer, 
       and then print out A, i and buf. */</font>

    } else if (c == 'W') {
      printf("Writing 0x67 to 0x%x\n", ptr);
      *ptr = 0x67;
      printf("A is now 0x%x\n", A);
      printf("i is now 0x%x\n", i);
      printf("buf is now %s\n", buf);

    <font color="blue">/* If c is 'X', then treat ptr as a procedure, and call it. */</font>

    } else if (c == 'X') {
      memcpy(&amp;proc, &amp;ptr, sizeof(void *));
      proc();
    }
  }

  return 0;
}
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></center><p>

So, what the program is allowing the user to do is enter an address, and then either
read from, write to, or execute code from that address.  Let's give it a try.  It is 
unfortunate that the memory addresses will change from when we called <b>look_at_memory</b>
above.  I'm only going to include output that is important to understanding this part of
the lecture:

</p><pre>UNIX&gt; <font color="darkred"><b>./mess_with_memory</b></font>

</pre>

All of these are straightforward -- we are reading the first byte of <b>A</b>, which,
because the Raspberry Pi is little endian, equals 4.  We set <b>i</b> to be <tt>0xabcd</tt>, so
its first byte is <tt>0xcd</tt> and its second byte is <tt>0xab</tt>.  Finally, <tt>0x1685008</tt>
is the value of <b>buf</b>, which is a heap address.  When we read it, we get <tt>0x30</tt>,
which is the ASCII character code for '0', which is the first character in the string
that we just read from the terminal.
<p>

We can write to these addresses as well -- the 'W' character says to write 0x67 to 
the address.  Below, we'll write it to <b>A</b>, to the third byte of <b>i</b>, and
to <b>buf</b>:

buf is now gx1685008 W    <font color="blue">We just wrote 0x67 ('g') to the first byte of buf</font>
</pre>

Recall that memory is partitioned by the processor into pages, and it manages the protection
of memory at the page level.  So, even though <b>&amp;end</b> is <tt>0x20e94</tt>, we
see from the <b>/proc/<i>pid</i>/maps</b> file that all memory up to <tt>0x20fff</tt>
is part of the global variable segment.  So, we can read and write <tt>0x20fff</tt>
without segfaulting, even though that doesn't have any meaning to our program:

<pre>Enter an address (with 0x), and R|W|X: <font color="darkred"><b>0x20fff W</b></font>
Writing 0x67 to 0x20fff
<font color="blue">Ignore the output</font>

Enter an address (with 0x), and R|W|X: <font color="darkred"><b>0x20fff R</b></font>
Reading 0x20fff
Read 0x67
</pre>

However, if we try to read 0x21000, we will segfault:

<pre>Enter an address (with 0x), and R|W|X: <font color="darkred"><b>0x21000 R</b></font>
Reading 0x21000
Segmentation fault
UNIX&gt; 
</pre>

We can read an execute memory in the code segment.  That seems pretty dangerous,
doesn't it?  Let's go ahead and read the first bytes of <b>main()</b> and <b>proc_a</b>:

<pre>UNIX&gt; <font color="darkred"><b>./mess_with_memory</b></font>
&amp;etext: 0x10b3c
&amp;edata: 0x20e80
&amp;end:   0x20e94

Code Addresses:
main:   0x1072c
proc_a: 0x10714

Global Variable Addresses:
&amp;A: 0x20e78
&amp;B: 0x20e7c
&amp;X: 0x20e8c
&amp;Y: 0x20e90

Heap Address:
buf: 0x824008

Stack Addresses:
&amp;i:    0x7ec4bb3c
&amp;buf:  0x7ec4bb38
&amp;argc: 0x7ec4bb24

<font color="blue">I'm omiting the maps</font>

Enter an address (with 0x), and R|W|X: <font color="darkred"><b>0x1072c R</b></font>
Reading 0x1072c
Read 0x10

Enter an address (with 0x), and R|W|X: <font color="darkred"><b>0x10714 R</b></font>
Reading 0x10714
Read 0x0
</pre>

That's not very exciting.  Now, let's set the function pointer <b>proc</b> to <tt>0x10714</tt>,
which is the first instruction of <b>proc_a</b>, and call <b>proc</b>.  You'll see that
it calls <b>proc_a</b>:

<pre>Enter an address (with 0x), and R|W|X: <font color="darkred"><b>0x10714 X</b></font>
Hi
</pre>

Can we call <b>main()</b>?  Why not!

<pre>Enter an address (with 0x), and R|W|X: <font color="darkred"><b>0x1072c X</b></font>
<font color="blue">The first lines, up to the heap addresses are the same as before.</font>
<font color="blue">I'm not including them here.</font>
Heap Address:
buf: 0x8240d8

Stack Addresses:
&amp;i:    0x7ec4bb0c
&amp;buf:  0x7ec4bb08
&amp;argc: 0x7ec4baf4
</pre>

Since we're calling <b>main()</b> recursively, you'll see that <b>buf</b> has a new
address, since we called <b>malloc()</b> again, and that the stack addresses are
smaller than they were previously.
<p>
How about if we call it on a heap address?  We will get a segmentation violation,
because the heap does not have execute permissions:

</p><pre>Enter an address (with 0x), and R|W|X: <font color="darkred"><b>0x824008 X</b></font>
Segmentation fault
</pre>

An observant student in class noted that the stack <i>did</i> have execute permissions.
That doesn't seem prudent.  If we try to an address in our current stack frame, 
we'll get an illegal instruction, since those addresses have not been set up as instructions:

<pre>UNIX&gt; <font color="darkred"><b>./mess_with_memory</b></font>
<font color="blue">Lines deleted</font>
Stack Addresses:
&amp;i:    0x7ef84b3c
&amp;buf:  0x7ef84b38
&amp;argc: 0x7ef84b24
<font color="blue">More deleted</font>

Enter an address (with 0x), and R|W|X: 0x7ef84b3c X
Illegal instruction
UNIX&gt; <font color="darkred"><b></b></font>
</pre>

I tried to then put real code onto the stack and run it, but it failed -- probing,
it has to do with ARM branch instructions, and I don't really want to go down that
rabbit hole.  Too bad.

<h3>Breaking the stack</h3>

It's not hard to break the stack -- simply do infinite recursion.  The
program 
<b><a href="http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~jplank/plank/classes/cs360/360/notes/Memory/break_the_stack.c">break_the_stack.c</a></b>
does this.  

<p></p><center><table border="3" cellpadding="3"><tbody><tr><td><pre>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main(int argc)
{
  char eight_K[8192];

  printf("Argc = %5d.  &amp;argc = 0x%x.\n", argc, &amp;argc);
  main(argc+1);
  return 0;
}
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></center><p>

Typically, the operating system allocates 8MB for the stack, so this program
should segfault in around 1024 iterations (less, because you are pushing more
onto the stack than the <b>eight_K</b> array):

</p><pre>UNIX&gt; <font color="darkred"><b>./break_the_stack</b></font>
Argc =     1.  &amp;argc = 0x7ec79b44.
Argc =     2.  &amp;argc = 0x7ec77b34.
Argc =     3.  &amp;argc = 0x7ec75b24.
Argc =     4.  &amp;argc = 0x7ec73b14.
....
Argc =  1019.  &amp;argc = 0x7e481ba4.
Argc =  1020.  &amp;argc = 0x7e47fb94.
Argc =  1021.  &amp;argc = 0x7e47db84.
Segmentation fault
UNIX&gt;
</pre>

You can also break the stack by simply allocating too much local memory.  A
declaration like the following will do:

<pre>   char big[10000000];
</pre>

<h3>What happens when you run out of heap space?</h3>

When this happens, <b>malloc()</b> returns NULL.  The program
<b><a href="http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~jplank/plank/classes/cs360/360/notes/Memory/break_the_heap.c">break_the_heap.c</a></b> keeps calling
<b>malloc()</b> for a megabyte, until <b>malloc()</b> fails.  On
my Raspberry pi, this happens after 2021 iterations, so it looks like
my process gets two gigabytes of heap space before the operating system
cries uncle...

<p></p><center><table border="3" cellpadding="3"><tbody><tr><td><pre>int main()
{
  int i;
  char *c;

  for (i = 0; i &lt; 1000000000; i++) {
    c = (char *) malloc(1024*1024);
    printf("%9d 0x%08lx\n", i, (unsigned long) c);
    if (c == NULL) exit(0);
  }
  return 0;
}
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></center><p>
