Threads programming is a paradigm of programming that is very powerful
and natural.  In a nutshell, threads let you have multiple processing
units, called ``threads'' that cooperate via shared memory.  

<hr>
<h2>Why threads?</h2>

There are many reasons to program with threads.  In the context of this
class, there are two important ones:
<ol>
<li> They allow you to deal with asynchronous events synchronously and
     efficiently.
</li><li> They allow you to get parallel performance on a shared-memory
     multiprocessor.
</li></ol>

You'll find threads to be a big help in writing an operating system. 
Therefore, by learning threads here, you get a leg up on your OS class
(that is, if they make you write an operating system....).

<hr>

<h2>What are threads?</h2>

What are threads?  Threads are often called "lightweight processes".
Whereas a typical process in Unix consists of CPU state (i.e. registers),
memory (code, globals, heap and stack), and OS info (such as open 
files, a process ID, etc), in a thread system
there is a larger entity, called a "task", a "pod", or sometimes
a "heavyweight process."

<p>The task consists of a memory (code, globals, heap), OS info, and
threads.  Each thread is a unit of execution, which consists of a 
stack and CPU state (i.e. registers).  Multiple threads resemble
multiple processes, except that multiple threads within a task use
the same code, globals and heap.  Thus, while two processes in Unix
can only communicate through the operating system (e.g. through files,
pipes, or sockets), two threads in a task can communicate through
memory.  

</p><p>When you program with threads, you assume that they execute 
simultaneously.  In other words, it should appear to you as if each
thread is executing on its own CPU, and that all the threads share
the same memory.

</p><p>There are various primitives that a thread system must provide.
Let's start with two basic ones.  In this initial discussion, I
am talking about a generic thread system.  We'll talk about specific
ones (such as POSIX) later.

</p><ul>
<pre><li> tcb thread_fork(procedure, arguments);
</li></pre>
<p>
    This says to create a new thread which runs the given procedure
    with the given arguments.  Sometimes the arguments are omitted, and
    sometimes only one argument (a <b>(void *)</b>) is allowed.  It returns
    a pointer to the new thread (which I'll call a thread control block or 
    TCB).

</p><pre><li> thread_join(tcb)
</li></pre>
<p>
    This says to wait for the thread represented by <b>tcb</b> to 
    finish executing.  Often <b>thread_join()</b> returns an integer
    or a <b>(void *)</b> as its exit value.  You can think of 
    <b>thread_join()</b> as analogous to <b>wait()</b> in Unix ---
    it waits for the specified thread to complete, and gathers 
    information about the thread's exit status.
</p></ul>

<hr>
<h2>Posix threads</h2>

On most Unix machines, there is a thread system that you can use.  
It is called ``Posix threads.'' 
To make use of Posix threads in your program, you need to have the
following include directive:
<pre>#include &lt;pthread.h&gt;
</pre>

And you have to link <b>libpthread.a</b> to your object files.  (i.e. if your
program is in <b>main.c</b>, you need to do the following to make your thread
executable):

<pre>UNIX&gt; <font color="darkred"><b>gcc -c main.c</b></font>
UNIX&gt; <font color="darkred"><b>gcc -o main main.o -lpthread</b></font>
</pre>

You can use pthreads with <b>g++</b> too.
There's a lot of junk in the <b>pthread</b> library.  
You can read about it in the
various man pages.  Start with ``<b>man pthread</b>''.   
The two basic primitives defined above are the following in Posix
threads:

<pre>     int pthread_create(pthread_t *new_thread_ID,
                        const pthread_attr_t *attr,
                        void * (*start_func)(void *), 
                        void *arg);

     int pthread_join(pthread_t target_thread, 
                      void **status);
</pre>

This isn't too bad, and not too far off from my generic description 
above.  Instead of returning a pointer to a thread control block, 
<b>pthread_create()</b>
has you pass the address of one, and it fills it in.  
Don't worry about the <b>attr</b> argument -- just use NULL.
Then <b>func</b> is
the function, and <b>arg</b> is the argument to the function, which is
a <b>(void *)</b>.  When <b>pthread_create</b> returns, the TCB is
in <b>*new_thread_ID</b>, and the new thread is running <b>func(arg)</b>.

<p><b>pthread_join()</b> has you specify a thread, and give a pointer to
a <b>(void *)</b>.  When the specified thread exits, the <b>pthread_join()</b>
call will return, and <b>*status</b> will be the return or exit value of
a thread.

</p><p>In all the Posix threads, calls, an integer is returned.  If zero, 
everything went ok.  Otherwise, an error has occurred.  As with system
calls, it is always good to check the return values of these calls to
see if there has been an error.  In my code here in the lecture

</p><p>How does a thread exit?  By calling <b>return</b> or <b>pthread_exit()</b>.

</p><p>Ok, so check out the following program (in <b><a href="http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~jplank/plank/classes/cs360/360/notes/Thread1/hw.c">hw.c</a></b>):

</p><p></p><center><table border="3" cellpadding="3"><tbody><tr><td><pre>#include &lt;pthread.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

<font color="blue">/* This is the procedure called by the thread.  I'm ignoring the argument
   (which is specified to be NULL in the pthread_create() calls. */</font>

void *printme()
{
  printf("Hello world\n");
  return NULL;
}

int main()
{
  pthread_t tcb;
  void *status;

  <font color="blue">/* Create one thread, which prints Hello World. */</font>

  if (pthread_create(&amp;tcb, NULL, printme, NULL) != 0) {
    perror("pthread_create");
    exit(1);
  }
  
  <font color="blue">/* Wait for that thread to exit, and then exit. */</font>

  if (pthread_join(tcb, &amp;status) != 0) { 
    perror("pthread_join"); 
    exit(1); 
  }

  return 0;
}
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></center><p>

Try copying <b>hw.c</b> to your home area, compiling it, and running it.
It should print out <b>``Hello world''</b>.

</p><hr>
<h2>Forking multiple threads</h2>

Now, look at <a href="http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~jplank/plank/classes/cs360/360/notes/Thread1/print4.c"><b>print4.c</b></a>.  

<p></p><center><table border="3" cellpadding="3"><tbody><tr><td><pre>#include &lt;pthread.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;

<font color="blue">/* Printme's argument is a (void *), which we know is actually an 
   (int *), pointing to the integer id of the thread, which is set
    up in main(). */</font>

void *printme(void *ip)
{
  int *i;

  i = (int *) ip;
  printf("Hi.  I'm thread %d\n", *i);
  return NULL;
}

int main()
{
  int i, ids[4];
  pthread_t tids[4];
  void *retval;

  <font color="blue">/* Fork off four "printme" threads, setting the argument to
     be a pointer to the thread's integer id. */</font>

  for (i = 0; i &lt; 4; i++) {
    ids[i] = i;
    if (pthread_create(tids+i, NULL, printme, ids+i) != 0) {
      perror("pthread_create");
      exit(0);
    }
  }

  <font color="blue">/* Join with the four threads. */</font>

  for (i = 0; i &lt; 4; i++) {
    printf("Trying to join with thread %d\n", i);
    if (pthread_join(tids[i], &amp;retval) != 0) { perror("join"); exit(1); }
    printf("Joined with thread %d\n", i);
  }
  return 0;
}
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></center><p>

This forks off 4 threads that print out <b>``Hi.  I'm thread n''</b>, 
where <b>n</b> goes from zero to three.  The main thread calls <b>pthread_join()</b>
so that it waits for all four threads to exit before it exits.  This should give you a
good idea of how multiple threads can co-exist in the same process.
</p><p>
</p><p>Here's the output of a call to <b>print4.c</b>:

</p><pre>UNIX&gt; <font color="darkred"><b>./print4</b></font>
Trying to join with tid 0
Hi.  I'm thread 0
Hi.  I'm thread 1
Hi.  I'm thread 2
Hi.  I'm thread 3
Joined with tid 0
Trying to join with tid 1
Joined with tid 1
Trying to join with tid 2
Joined with tid 2
Trying to join with tid 3
Joined with tid 3
UNIX&gt; <font color="darkred"><b></b></font>
</pre>

Here's what happened: The <b>main()</b> program got control
after forking off the four threads.  It called <b>pthread_join</b> for
thread zero and blocked.  Then thread zero got control, printed its line,
and exited.  Next came threads one, two and three.  When they finished,
the <b>main()</b> thread got control again and since thread zero was done,
its <b>pthread_join()</b> call returned.  Then it made the <b>pthread_join()</b>
calls for threads one, two and three, all of which returned since these 
threads were done.  When <b>main()</b> returned, all the threads are done,
and the program exited.
<p>
Now, that's not the only possible output of the program.  In particular, here
are three more runs of the program, which all have different outputs:

</p><pre>UNIX&gt; <font color="darkred"><b>./print4</b></font>
Hi.  I'm thread 0
Hi.  I'm thread 1
Hi.  I'm thread 2
Trying to join with tid 0
Joined with tid 0
Trying to join with tid 1
Joined with tid 1
Trying to join with tid 2
Joined with tid 2
Trying to join with tid 3
Hi.  I'm thread 3
Joined with tid 3
UNIX&gt; <font color="darkred"><b>./print4</b></font>

Trying to join with tid 0

UNIX&gt; <font color="darkred"><b></b></font>
</pre>

You'll note that these are quite different.  Each of them is the result of the
threads getting scheduled in different orders.  Let's think about this more.  
In particular, think about what's going on after the main thread calls
<b>pthread_create()</b> for the first time.  At that point, there are two threads -- the
main thread and thread 0.  Either of them can run, and it's up to the operating system
to select one.  If the operating system is managing two processors, it may choose to run 
each thread simultaneously on a different processor.  
<p>
If thread 0 gets control first, you'll see the output "Hi.  I'm thread 0" first.  If
the main thread gets control first, then it will call <b>pthread_create()</b> for thread 1,
and you'll have three threads that can all run.  For each output above, you can derive an
ordering of the threads that generates the output.  For example in that last output, 
the main thread creates thread 2 before the first line of output is printed, and that line
is printed by thread 2.  
</p><p>
This is simultaneously what makes threaded programs great and difficult.  They are great because
they allow multiple threads to run at the same time (either on different processors, or on
one processor, scheduled by the operating system).  They are difficult for the same reason.
One of the challenged of this type of programming is allowing for the threads to do as much
as they can simultaneously without getting yourself in trouble.

</p><hr>
<h3>exit() vs pthread_exit()</h3>

In <b>pthreads</b> there are two things you should know about thread/program
termination.  The first is that <b>pthread_exit()</b> makes a thread exit,
but keeps the task alive, while <b>exit()</b> terminates the task.  If
all threads (and the <b>main()</b> program should be considered a thread)
have terminated, then the task terminates.  So, look at 
<b><a href="http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~jplank/plank/classes/cs360/360/notes/Thread1/p4a.c">p4a.c</a></b>.

<p>Here, all threads, including the <b>main()</b> thread, exit with 
<b>pthread_exit()</b>.  You'll see that the output is the same as 
<b>print4</b>.

</p><p>Now, look at <b><a href="http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~jplank/plank/classes/cs360/360/notes/Thread1/p4b.c">p4b.c</a></b>.  Here, we put a 
<b>pthread_exit()</b> call in <b>main()</b> before making the <b>join</b>
calls.  The output is:

</p><pre>Hi.  I'm thread 0
Hi.  I'm thread 1
Hi.  I'm thread 2
Hi.  I'm thread 3
</pre>

You'll note that none of the "Joining" lines were printed out because
the main thread had exited.  However, the other threads ran just fine, and
the program terminated when all the threads had exited.

<p>
The second thing you need to know is that
when a forked thread returns from its initial calling procedure (e.g.
<b>printme</b> in <b>print4.c</b>), then that is the same as calling
<b>pthread_exit()</b>.  However, if the <b>main()</b> thread returns, then
that is the same as calling <b>exit()</b>, and the task dies.  Take 
a look at <b><a href="http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~jplank/plank/classes/cs360/360/notes/Thread1/p4c.c">p4c.c</a></b>.  This is the same as
<b><a href="http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~jplank/plank/classes/cs360/360/notes/Thread1/print4.c">print4.c</a></b>, except for two changes:

</p><ol>
<li> The threads sleep for a second beefore printing.
</li><li> The main thread doesn't call <b>pthread_join()</b>, and instead
     returns from <b>main()</b> after forking the threads.
</li></ol>

When we run it, we get no output:

<pre>UNIX&gt; <font color="darkred"><b>./p4c</b></font>
UNIX&gt; <font color="darkred"><b></b></font>
</pre>

The reason for this is that when the main thread returns, the other four threads
have been created, and are either sleeping, or have not executed yet.  
When the main thread returns, the task is terminated, killing the threads.  Thus,
they do not print anything.
<p>
If you change the return statement in the <b>main()</b> routine to <b>pthread_exit()</b>,
then it does not kill the process, and the four threads run to completion.

</p><p>
Finally, look at <b><a href="http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~jplank/plank/classes/cs360/360/notes/Thread1/p4d.c">p4d.c</a></b>.  Here, the threads call
<b>exit()</b> instead of <b>pthread_exit()</b>.  You'll note that the output
is:

</p><pre>UNIX&gt; <font color="darkred"><b>./p4d</b></font>
Hi.  I'm thread 0
Trying to join with thread 0
UNIX&gt; 
</pre>

This is because the task is terminated by thread 0's <b>exit()</b> call.

<hr>
<h3>Preemption versus non-preemption</h3>

Now, take a look at 
<b><a href="http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~jplank/plank/classes/cs360/360/notes/Thread1/iloop.c">iloop.c</a></b>.  Here, four threads are forked off,
and then the <b>main()</b> thread goes into an infinite loop.  When you
execute it, what do you think you'll see?  I can think of two answers.
One is that you'll see nothing -- the <b>main()</b> thread spins forever,
and the other threads don't run.  The second answer is that the <b>main()</b>
thread will run, but the other threads will also get the CPU at some point
and run to completion.  
<p>
The underlying issue here is called <i>preemption</i>.  If your thread
system is <i>preemptive</i>, then although the <b>main</b> thread
gets most of the CPU, the thread system interrupts it at certain 
points (i.e. it <i>preempts</i> the <b>main()</b> thread), and runs
the other threads.
</p><p>
POSIX thread systems under Solaris used to be non-preemptive.  Under 
LINUX, they are preemptive.  So, in our labs (which are LINUX boxes), 
<b>iloop</b> runs as follows:
</p><pre>UNIX&gt; <font color="darkred"><b>./iloop</b></font>
Hi.  I'm thread 0
Hi.  I'm thread 1
Hi.  I'm thread 2
Hi.  I'm thread 3
</pre>
<p>
There are some machines
that have multiple CPU's attached to a single memory.  These systems
are by nature preemptive, since different threads will actually execute
on different CPU's.  However, whether or not a thread system is
preemptive is an attribute that you must discern when you are programming
for a thread system.
</p><p>A non-preemptive thread system on a system with a single CPU (called
a "uniprocessor") may seem useless, but in actuality it is extremely 
useful.  

</p><hr>
<h3>Pthread_detach()</h3>

Threads consume resources.  In particular, each thread executes on its own stack,
which requires memory.  When a thread exits, the thread system has to decide whether
to release its resources or not.  It makes that decision in one of two ways:
<p>
</p><ol>
<li> If another thread calls <b>pthread_join()</b> on the thread, then upon completion
of the <b>pthread_join()</b> call, the thread's resources are released.
<p>
</p></li><li> If any thread (typically the thread itself) calls <b>pthread_detach()</b> on the
thread, then no <b>pthread_join()</b> call is required.  The thread's resources will be
released instantly when the thread exits.  More often than not, it is what you want.
</li></ol>
<p>
To call <b>pthread_detach()</b> on yourself, you call

<h3>Threaded Telnet, and Minitalk Done Right</h3>

Threads provide the perfect framework for writing programs that deal with asynchrony.
In particular, in our lecture notes on sockets, we had some problems writing programs that
needed to do the following operations simultaneously:

<ul>
<li> Read standard input so that it could be written to a socket.
</li><li> Read from the socket so that it could be written to standard output.
</li></ul>

We solved that problem by forking off processes.  With threads, you can do these simultaneous
operations in one process.  That is often essential because you want your various 
operaions to share information.
<p>
In this section, we'll first write a threaded <b>telnet</b> client.
This is a client that will request a connection to a socket, and then
do what we specify above -- anything typed into standard input will
go to the socket, and anything that comes from the socket will go to
standard output.
</p><p>
The program is in 
<b><a href="http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~jplank/plank/classes/cs360/360/notes/Thread1/th_telnet.c">th_telnet.c</a></b>, and you should study it.  The
comments specify exactly what it is doing:

</p><p></p><center><table border="3" cellpadding="3"><tbody><tr><td><pre>#include &lt;pthread.h&gt;

  char buf[1000];

  connection = (FILE **) c;
  while (fgets(buf, 1000, connection[0]) != NULL) {
    printf("Read: %s", buf);

    exit(1);
  }

  (void) process_connection(stdin_to_socket);
  return 0;
}
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></center><p>

Let's try it, using <b>alternate</b> from the Socket lecture notes as the server:

You'll note, when the left person wrote "So stop saying that," it was read and sent along
the socket instantly.  However, because <b>alternate</b> alternates strictly, it was not 
read from the socket until after the second person wrote "It is only proper."  
</p><p>
The program 
<b><a href="http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~jplank/plank/classes/cs360/360/notes/Thread1/real_minitalk.c">real_minitalk.c</a></b>
has both the client and server code for a two-person talk program.  It is very much 
like <b>th_telnet</b>, except it has code for setting up the server, and it doesn't 
print the "Read" like like <b>th_telnet</b>.  What you should notice is that 
it's ok for one of the two programs to type lots of input, and it works fine.  That's
because each program has two threads -- one to handle standard input, and one to handle
the thread.
