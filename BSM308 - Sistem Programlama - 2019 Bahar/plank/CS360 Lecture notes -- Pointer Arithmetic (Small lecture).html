There's really nothing new in this small lecture - just some reinforcement 
from the last lecture.
<hr>

We've used pointers in CS140 and CS302.  If you want some review, 
please see
<a href="http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~jplank/plank/classes/cs140/Notes/Pointers/index.html">
pointer lecture notes from CS140</a>.  For additional reinforcement, I have a 
set of <a href="http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~jplank/plank/classes/cs302/Notes/Kurt/">old 
lecture notes from CS302 where I set up more STL data structures
that point to each other with pointers.</a>
Both of these are in C++.
<p>
There is no standard template library in C.  This means that vectors, lists, sets
and maps are gone.  We will replace all of them in the next few lectures.  We'll
start with vectors.  In C, we use arrays instead of vectors.  You can statically
declare an array by putting <b>[size]</b> in the variable declaration.  For example,
the following variable declaration will create an array <b>iarray</b> of ten integers:

</p><p></p><center><table border="3" cellpadding="3"><tbody><tr><td><pre>int iarray[10];
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></center><p>

You can access the elements of <b>iarray</b> in square brackets.  Unlike C++, <b>iarray</b>
has no methods.  In particular, the size of <b>iarray</b> is not stored anywhere -- you
have to keep track of it yourself.
</p><p>
In reality, <b>iarray</b> is a pointer to the first element of the array.  In other words,
there are 40 bytes allocated for the array (since integers are four bytes each),
and <b>iarray</b> points to the first of these.  If we want, we can set a second pointer
to <b>iarray</b>, and we can print the elements of <b>iarray</b> by incrementing the 
pointer and dereferencing it.  We do all of that in 
<b><a href="http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~jplank/plank/classes/cs360/360/notes/Pointer-Arithmetic/ptr1.c">ptr1.c</a></b>:

</p><p></p><center><table border="3" cellpadding="3"><tbody><tr><td><pre>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

int main()
{
  int iarray[10];
  int *ip;
  int i;

  for (i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++) iarray[i] = 100+i;

  printf("iarray = 0x%lx\n", (unsigned long) iarray);

  ip = iarray;

  for (i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++) {
    printf("i=%d.  iarray[i]=%d.  ip = 0x%lx.  *ip=%d.  (ip-iarray)=%d\n", 
        i, iarray[i], (unsigned long) ip, *ip, (int) (ip-iarray));
    ip++;
  }
}
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></center><p>

In the <b>for</b> loop, we print out five quantities:
</p><p>
</p><ul>
<li> <b>i</b>, which will go from 0 to 9.
</li><li> <b>iarray[i]</b>, which will go from 100 to 109.
</li><li> <b>ip</b>, which will start out equaling <b>iarray</b>, and will be incremented
on each iteration.
</li><li> <b>*ip</b>, which will go from 100 to 109, since it is going to successively point to
  each element of <b>iarray</b>.
</li><li> <b>(ip - iarray)</b>, which will equal <b>i</b>.
</li></ul>
Let's take a look at output:

<pre>UNIX&gt; <font color="darkred"><b>./ptr1</b></font>
iarray = 0x7fff5fbfdc40
i=0.  iarray[i]=100.  ip = 0x7fff5fbfdc40.  *ip=100.  (ip-iarray)=0
i=1.  iarray[i]=101.  ip = 0x7fff5fbfdc44.  *ip=101.  (ip-iarray)=1
i=2.  iarray[i]=102.  ip = 0x7fff5fbfdc48.  *ip=102.  (ip-iarray)=2
i=3.  iarray[i]=103.  ip = 0x7fff5fbfdc4c.  *ip=103.  (ip-iarray)=3
i=4.  iarray[i]=104.  ip = 0x7fff5fbfdc50.  *ip=104.  (ip-iarray)=4
i=5.  iarray[i]=105.  ip = 0x7fff5fbfdc54.  *ip=105.  (ip-iarray)=5
i=6.  iarray[i]=106.  ip = 0x7fff5fbfdc58.  *ip=106.  (ip-iarray)=6
i=7.  iarray[i]=107.  ip = 0x7fff5fbfdc5c.  *ip=107.  (ip-iarray)=7
i=8.  iarray[i]=108.  ip = 0x7fff5fbfdc60.  *ip=108.  (ip-iarray)=8
i=9.  iarray[i]=109.  ip = 0x7fff5fbfdc64.  *ip=109.  (ip-iarray)=9
UNIX&gt; <font color="darkred"><b></b></font>
</pre>

Everything in hex will change from machine to machine.  However, their interrelationship will
always be the same.  In the <b>for</b> loop, <b>i</b>, <b>iarray[i]</b> and <b>*ip</b>
should all be straightforward and require no explanation.  I'll explain the others in
detail.
<p>
When this program starts to run, the operating system has set it up so that the 40 bytes
starting with <tt>0x7fff5fbfdc40</tt> are where <b>iarray</b> is stored.  That is why <b>iarray</b>
is equal to <tt>0x7fff5fbfdc40</tt>.  If <b>iarray[0]</b> is the four bytes that start at
<tt>0x7fff5fbfdc40</tt>, then <b>iarray[1]</b> must be the four bytes that start at
<tt>0x7fff5fbfdc44</tt>.  This is why <b>ip</b> is equal to <tt>0x7fff5fbfdc44 </tt>on the second iteration 
of the <b>for</b> loop.
</p><p>
While this is all logical, it is a little confusing: adding one to <b>ip</b> actually
adds four to the value of the pointer.  
This is called "pointer arithmetic" -- when you add <i>x</i>
to a pointer, it really adds <i>sx</i> to it, where <i>s</i> is the size of data to 
which the pointer points.  
</p><p>
The last column printed in the <b>for</b> loop is a little confusing too.  Again, focus
on the line where <b>i</b> equals one.  <b>ip</b> is equal to <tt>0x7fff5fbfdc44</tt>, so you 
would think that <b>(ip-iarray)</b> would equal four.  It does not, because the compiler
is doing pointer arithmetic -- from the point of view of the compiler, when you 
say "<b>ip-iarray</b>," you are asking for the number of elements between <b>ip</b>
and <b>iarray</b>.  That will be the difference between the pointers, divided by the
size of the element.  In this case, it is <tt>(0x7fff5fbfdc44-0x7fff5fbfdc40)/4</tt>, 
which equals one.
</p><p>
To help hammer this home a little further, I have three other programs where are
nearly identical to <b>ptr.c</b>:
</p><p>
</p><ul>
<li> <b><a href="http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~jplank/plank/classes/cs360/360/notes/Pointer-Arithmetic/cptr.c">cptr.c</a></b>: The array is <b>char</b>'s, so the pointer's
value is actually incremented by one on each iteration.
</li><li> <b><a href="http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~jplank/plank/classes/cs360/360/notes/Pointer-Arithmetic/dptr.c">dptr.c</a></b>: The array is <b>double</b>'s, so the pointer's
value is actually incremented by eight on each iteration.
</li><li> <b><a href="http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~jplank/plank/classes/cs360/360/notes/Pointer-Arithmetic/sptr.c">sptr.c</a></b>: The array is a struct of two <b>double</b>'s, so the pointer's
value is actually incremented by sixteen on each iteration.
</li></ul>

That last one is worth looking at it its entirety:
<p></p><center><table border="3" cellpadding="3"><tbody><tr><td><pre>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

typedef struct {
  double d1;
  double d2;
} Two;

int main()
{
  Two iarray[10];
  Two *ip;
  int i;

  for (i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++) { 
    iarray[i].d1 = 100+i;
    iarray[i].d2 = 200+i;
  }

  printf("iarray = 0x%lx\n", (unsigned long) iarray);

  ip = iarray;

  for (i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++) {
    printf("i=%d.  iarray[i]={%.2lf,%.2lf}.  ip = 0x%lx.  *ip={%.2lf,%.2lf}.  (ip-iarray)=%d\n", 
        i, iarray[i].d1, iarray[i].d2, (unsigned long) ip, ip-&gt;d1, ip-&gt;d2, (int) (ip-iarray));
    ip++;
  }
}
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></center><p>

In particular, I use the arrow to dereference different parts of the struct from the 
pointer: <b>ip-&gt;d1</b> accesses <b>d1</b>, and 
<b>ip-&gt;d2</b> accesses <b>d2</b>.  
</p><p>
You can force your machine into 32-bit mode by using the compiler directive <b>-m32</b>.
Let's do that with the last program:

</p><pre>UNIX&gt; <font color="darkred"><b>gcc -m32 -o sptr sptr.c</b></font>
UNIX&gt; <font color="darkred"><b>./sptr</b></font>
iarray = 0xbfffdd98
i=0.  iarray[i]={100.00,200.00}.  ip = 0xbfffdd98.  *ip={100.00,200.00}.  (ip-iarray)=0
i=1.  iarray[i]={101.00,201.00}.  ip = 0xbfffdda8.  *ip={101.00,201.00}.  (ip-iarray)=1
i=2.  iarray[i]={102.00,202.00}.  ip = 0xbfffddb8.  *ip={102.00,202.00}.  (ip-iarray)=2
i=3.  iarray[i]={103.00,203.00}.  ip = 0xbfffddc8.  *ip={103.00,203.00}.  (ip-iarray)=3
i=4.  iarray[i]={104.00,204.00}.  ip = 0xbfffddd8.  *ip={104.00,204.00}.  (ip-iarray)=4
i=5.  iarray[i]={105.00,205.00}.  ip = 0xbfffdde8.  *ip={105.00,205.00}.  (ip-iarray)=5
i=6.  iarray[i]={106.00,206.00}.  ip = 0xbfffddf8.  *ip={106.00,206.00}.  (ip-iarray)=6
i=7.  iarray[i]={107.00,207.00}.  ip = 0xbfffde08.  *ip={107.00,207.00}.  (ip-iarray)=7
i=8.  iarray[i]={108.00,208.00}.  ip = 0xbfffde18.  *ip={108.00,208.00}.  (ip-iarray)=8
i=9.  iarray[i]={109.00,209.00}.  ip = 0xbfffde28.  *ip={109.00,209.00}.  (ip-iarray)=9
UNIX&gt; <font color="darkred"><b></b></font>
</pre>

As you can see, the pointers are smaller (8 hex digits).  However, their interrelationship
is the same, and each time you increment <b>ip</b>, its value is increased by 16.

When you run this, the first line of output is:

</p><pre>UNIX&gt; ./quiz
ip: 0xeffff9fc, &amp;ip: 0xeffff9cc, array: 0xeffff9d0

</pre>
What is the rest of the output?
<p>
(In class, I used the following drawing to help illustrate.  You can 
get them in <a href="http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~jplank/plank/classes/cs360/360/notes/Pointer-Arithmetic/Little-Quiz-Helper.odp">Little-Quiz-Helper.odp (Open Office)</a>

</p><p>
This is tricky, but you should be able to do it with all you currently
know about pointers.  This is the kind of question I am fond of asking
on tests. Here's the answer.  If you want to make sure you're doing
things right, try to draw a picture of memory and fill in what that
first line tells you.  Here would be my picture.  We'll start with 
a blank slate with the relevant addresses from the first line of 
the program:
</p><p></p><center><table border="3" cellpadding="3"><tbody><tr><td><pre>0xeffff9cc: |                        |
0xeffff9d0: |                        |
0xeffff9d4: |                        |
0xeffff9d8: |                        |
0xeffff9dc: |                        |
0xeffff9e0: |                        |
0xeffff9e4: |                        |
0xeffff9e8: |                        |
0xeffff9ec: |                        |
0xeffff9f0: |                        |
0xeffff9f4: |                        |
0xeffff9f8: |                        |
0xeffff9fc: |                        |
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></center><p>
Now, what do we know from the first line of output.  Well, the 
address of <b>ip</b> is <tt>0xeffff9cc</tt>, and its value is
<tt>0xeffff9fc</tt>.  So we can draw in its value at that address:
</p><p></p><center><table border="3" cellpadding="3"><tbody><tr><td><pre>0xeffff9cc: | ip = 0xeffff9fc        |
0xeffff9d0: |                        |
0xeffff9d4: |                        |
0xeffff9d8: |                        |
0xeffff9dc: |                        |
0xeffff9e0: |                        |
0xeffff9e4: |                        |
0xeffff9e8: |                        |
0xeffff9ec: |                        |
0xeffff9f0: |                        |
0xeffff9f4: |                        |
0xeffff9f8: |                        |
0xeffff9fc: |                        |
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></center><p>
From line 9, we know that the address of <b>i</b> is equal to <b>ip</b>.
Moreover, <b>i</b>'s value is 11, so we can draw that in:
</p><p></p><center><table border="3" cellpadding="3"><tbody><tr><td><pre>0xeffff9cc: | ip = 0xeffff9fc        |
0xeffff9d0: |                        |
0xeffff9d4: |                        |
0xeffff9d8: |                        |
0xeffff9dc: |                        |
0xeffff9e0: |                        |
0xeffff9e4: |                        |
0xeffff9e8: |                        |
0xeffff9ec: |                        |
0xeffff9f0: |                        |
0xeffff9f4: |                        |
0xeffff9f8: |                        |
0xeffff9fc: | i = 11                 |
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></center><p>
Now, <b>array</b> is a pointer to the first element of the 10-element
array.  Since its value is <tt>0xeffff9d0</tt>, we can draw in all ten elements
of the array:
</p><p></p><center><table border="3" cellpadding="3"><tbody><tr><td><pre>0xeffff9cc: | ip = 0xeffff9fc        |
0xeffff9d0: | array[0] = 0           |
0xeffff9d4: | array[1] = 1           |
0xeffff9d8: | array[2] = 2           |
0xeffff9dc: | array[3] = 3           |
0xeffff9e0: | array[4] = 4           |
0xeffff9e4: | array[5] = 5           |
0xeffff9e8: | array[6] = 6           |
0xeffff9ec: | array[7] = 7           |
0xeffff9f0: | array[8] = 8           |
0xeffff9f4: | array[9] = 9           |
0xeffff9f8: |                        |
0xeffff9fc: | i = 11                 |
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></center><p>

Now we know all we need to know.  Since <b>&amp;i</b> equals <b>ip</b>,
the first line of output is "<tt>&amp;i: 0xeffff9fc.</tt>"  Next, from line
10 of the program, we know that <b>ipp</b> equals the address of
<b>ip</b>.  So the next line is:
</p><pre>ipp: 0xeffff9cc, *ipp: 0xeffff9fc, **ipp: 0xb
</pre>
Note, that last word is <tt>0xb</tt>, and not 11, because we are printing 11 
in hexadecimal.
<p>
Now, since <b>a1</b> is a pointer to <b>array[1]</b>, its value is
<tt>0xeffff9d4</tt>.  Thus, our next line of output (after the blank line) is:
</p><pre>a1: 0xeffff9d4, *a1: 0x1
</pre>
Finally, 
the statement ``<b>a1 += 4</b>'' is pointer arithmetic.
It sets <b>a1</b> ahead four ints.  Therefore, it adds 16 to the 
value of <b>a1</b> -- 16 because ints are 4 bytes: 4*4 = 16.  After
the statement it points to <b>array[5]</b>.  Therefore, the last line is
<pre>0 1 2 3 4 500 6 7 8 9 
</pre>
Here is the entire output:
<p></p><center><table border="3" cellpadding="3"><tbody><tr><td><pre>ip: 0xeffff9fc, &amp;ip: 0xeffff9cc, array: 0xeffff9d0

&amp;i: 0xeffff9fc
ipp: 0xeffff9cc, *ipp: 0xeffff9fc, **ipp: 0xb

a1: 0xeffff9d4, *a1: 0x1
0 1 2 3 4 500 6 7 8 9 
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></center><p>
</p><p>
The output can differ from machine to machine, but it totally dependent on the
first line.  Here it is compiled in 64-bit mode on my Macbook:

</p><pre>UNIX&gt; <font color="darkred"><b>./quiz</b></font>
ip: 0x7fff5fbfdc7c, &amp;ip: 0x7fff5fbfdc70, array: 0x7fff5fbfdc30

At this point, I urge you to study 
exam questions from 
<a href="http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~jplank/plank/classes/cs360/360/oldtests/t0.html">old
pointer midterm exams</a>.
Reading memory and pointers is an important 
part of systems programming and these questions give you very good practice with it.
