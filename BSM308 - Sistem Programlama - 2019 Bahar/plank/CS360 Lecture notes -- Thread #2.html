In this lecture, we cover race conditions and mutexes.

<h3>Race conditions</h3>

A race condition is when a piece of code, with multiple units of execution (such as threads),
has a piece of data which can be read and written in multiple, unspecified, orders.
Race conditions are typically bad.  I say "typically," because sometimes they won't matter.
However, usually a race condition in your code is going to be a bug eventually, so it is a
good idea to know how to recognize race conditions, and how to use synchronization 
data structures (such as mutexes and condition variables) to avoid them, while still 
allowing a good degree of parallelism.
<p>
Take a look at 
<b><a href="http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~jplank/plank/classes/cs360/360/notes/Thread2/race1.c">race1.c</a></b>.  Its explanation is inline with the code:

Ok -- this program forks off two threads.  Each thread has its own <b>Info</b> struct,
which contains an id unique to the thread -- either 0 or 1.  The <b>Info</b> struct also
has a pointer to a <b>Shared_Info</b> struct, which is shared between the two threads.
The <b>Shared_Info</b> struct has two variables -- <b>i</b>, which each thread is going to
repeatedly overwrite with its id, and <b>die</b>, which each thread checks, and when it is
one, the threads exit.
</p><p>
Ask yourself the following question: <i>Where are the <b>Info</b> and <b>Shared_Info</b> structs
stored?  Heap or stack?  If stack, whose stack?</i>
</p><p>
The answer is that they are stored on the main thread's stack.  There is no restriction on 
where threads can access memory -- a pointer is a pointer, and if it points to another thread's
stack, so be it!
</p><p>
It should be pretty clear that this program has a race condition.  The two threads are wontonly
overwriting <b>I-&gt;SI-&gt;i</b> without any synchronization.  If I asked you what the output of
this program will be, you have to say that you don't really know.  It can be one of four
things:

</p><pre>UNIX&gt; <font color="darkred"><b>./race1</b></font>
0
1
UNIX&gt; <font color="darkred"><b>./race1</b></font>
1
0
UNIX&gt; <font color="darkred"><b>./race1</b></font>
0
0
UNIX&gt; <font color="darkred"><b>./race1</b></font>
1
1
UNIX&gt;
</pre>
The shell script 
<b><a href="http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~jplank/plank/classes/cs360/360/notes/Thread2/r1.sh">r1.sh</a></b> runs it 100 times, putting the output of each run on a single
line.  After taking the 200 seconds to run the shell script, you can see that all outputs
have occurred:

<pre>UNIX&gt; <font color="darkred"><b>sh r1.sh &gt; r1-output.txt</b></font>
UNIX&gt; <font color="darkred"><b>grep '0 0' r1-output.txt | wc</b></font>
      26      52     104
UNIX&gt; <font color="darkred"><b>grep '0 1' r1-output.txt | wc</b></font>
      55     110     220
UNIX&gt; <font color="darkred"><b>grep '1 0' r1-output.txt | wc</b></font>
      10      20      40
UNIX&gt; <font color="darkred"><b>grep '1 1' r1-output.txt | wc</b></font>
       9      18      36
UNIX&gt; <font color="darkred"><b></b></font>
</pre>

<p>
This is most definitely a race condition.  Is it a bad one?  Not really, because this program
doesn't do anything but demonstrate a race condition.  Let's look at a more complex race 
condition:

</p><hr>
<h3>Race2.c: A more complex race condition.</h3>

Look at 
<a href="http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~jplank/plank/classes/cs360/360/notes/Thread2/race2.c"><b>race2.c</b></a>.
This is another pretty simple program.  The command line arguments call for
the user to specify the number of threads, a string size and a number
of iterations.  Then the program does the following.  It allocates
an array of <b>stringsize</b> characters.  Then it forks off <b>nthreads</b>
threads, passing each thread its id, the number of iterations, and 
the character array.  Each thread loops for the
specified number of iterations.  At each iteration, it fills in the
character array  with one character -- thread 0 uses 'A', thread 1 uses
'B' and so on.  At the end of an iteration, the thread prints out the
character array.  So, if we call it with the arguments 4, 4, 1, we'd
expect the following output:
<pre>UNIX&gt; <font color="darkred"><b>./race2 4 4 1</b></font>
Thread 0: AAA
Thread 1: BBB
Thread 2: CCC
Thread 3: DDD
UNIX&gt; 
</pre>
Similarly, the following make sense:
<pre>UNIX&gt; <font color="darkred"><b>./race2 4 4 2</b></font>
Thread 0: AAA
Thread 0: AAA
Thread 1: BBB
Thread 1: BBB
Thread 2: CCC
Thread 2: CCC
Thread 3: DDD
Thread 3: DDD
UNIX&gt; <font color="darkred"><b>./race2 4 30 2</b></font>
Thread 0: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Thread 0: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Thread 1: BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB
Thread 1: BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB
Thread 2: CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC
Thread 2: CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC
Thread 3: DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
Thread 3: DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
UNIX&gt; 
</pre>

Unfortunately, that output is not 
guaranteed.  The reason is that 
threads can be preempted anywhere.  In particular,
they may be preempted in the middle of the <b>for()</b> loop, or
in the middle of the <b>printf()</b> statement.  This can lead to 
strange output.  For example, try the following:
<pre>UNIX&gt; <font color="darkred"><b>./race2 2 70 200000 | grep 'AB'</b></font>
</pre>
This searches for output lines where the character 'A' is followed by a B.
When I ran this, I got:

<pre>UNIX&gt; <font color="darkred"><b>./race2 2 70 200000 | grep 'AB'</b></font>
Thread 0: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB
Thread 1: AAAABBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB
UNIX&gt; 
</pre>

This shows two instances where thread 0 was interrupted by thread 1, which had
been interrupted in the middle of its <b>for</b> loop.  When thread 1 resumed, 
it overwrote the string with B's.
<p>
So, this program too has a race condition, this time with the shared array <b>s</b>.  
The output above is particularly confusing, which is often what happens with race 
conditions.
</p><p>
When you program with threads, you must pay attention to shared memory.  If
more than one thread can modify the shared memory, then you often need 
to protect the memory so that wierd things do not happen to the memory.
</p><p>
In our <b>race2</b> program, we can "fix" the race condition by enforcing
that no thread can be interrupted by another thread when it is modifying
and printing <b>s</b>.  This can be done with a <b>mutex</b>, sometimes
called a "lock" or sometimes a "binary semaphore."  There are three
procedures for dealing with mutexes in pthreads:
</p><pre>int pthread_mutex_init(pthread_mutex_t *mutex, NULL);
int pthread_mutex_lock(pthread_mutex_t *mutex);
int pthread_mutex_unlock(pthread_mutex_t *mutex);
</pre>
<p>
All three return 0 on success and somethine else if they fail.
</p><p>
You create a mutex with <b>pthread_mutex_init()</b>.  You have to
have allocated memory for it ahead of time (i.e.
<b>pthread_mutex_init()</b> does not call <b>malloc()</b>.  Then any
thread may lock or unlock the mutex.  When a thread locks the mutex,
no other thread may lock it.  If a thread calls
<b>pthread_mutex_lock()</b> while the mutex is locked, then the
thread will block until the mutex is unlocked.  Only one thread may
lock the mutex at a time.
</p><p>
<i><b><font color="darkgreen">I want to point out here, that pthread_mutex_lock() does not actively "lock"
other threads.  Instead, it locks a data structure, which can be shared among the
threads.  The locking and unlocking of the data structure makes synchronization guarantees,
which are very important to avoiding race conditions.  However, I don't want you to get into
the habit of thinking that pthread_mutex_lock() actively blocks other threads, or "locks them
out."  It doesn't -- it locks a data structure, and when other threads try to lock the 
same data structure, they block.  Please reread this paragraph.</font></b></i>
</p><p>
So, we "fix" the program with 
<a href="http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~jplank/plank/classes/cs360/360/notes/Thread2/race3.c"><b>race3.c</b></a>.  You'll notice that a thread locks 
the mutex just before modifying <b>s</b> and it unlocks the mutex 
just after printing <b>s</b>.  This fixes the program so that the output
makes sense:

</p><pre>UNIX&gt; <font color="darkred"><b>race3 4 4 1</b></font>
Thread 0: AAA
Thread 1: BBB
Thread 2: CCC
Thread 3: DDD
UNIX&gt; <font color="darkred"><b>race3 4 4 2</b></font>
Thread 0: AAA
Thread 0: AAA
Thread 2: CCC
Thread 2: CCC
Thread 1: BBB
Thread 1: BBB
Thread 3: DDD
Thread 3: DDD
UNIX&gt; <font color="darkred"><b>race3 4 70 1</b></font>
Thread 0: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Thread 1: BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB
Thread 2: CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC
Thread 3: DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
UNIX&gt; <font color="darkred"><b>race3 2 70 100000 | grep AB</b></font>     <font color="blue">This call will never have any output because of the mutex.</font>
UNIX&gt; 
</pre>

<h3>Terse advice on mutexes</h3>

One of the challenges in dealing with synchronization primitives is to get
what you want without constricting the threads system too much.   For 
example, in your <b>jtalk_server</b> program, you will have to have a 
data structure that holds all of the current connections.  When someone
attaches to the socket, you add the connection to that data structure.
When someone quits his/her <b>jtalk</b> session, then you delete the
connection from the data structure.  And when someone sends a line to
the server, you will traverse the data structure, and send the line
to all the connections.  You will need to protect the data structure
with a mutex.  For example, you do not want to be traversing the
data structure and deleting a connection at the same time.  One thing
you want to think about is how to protect the data structure, but 
at the same time not cause too many threads to block on the mutex if
they really don't have to.  We'll talk more about this later.

<h2>Preemption</h2>

<font color="red"><b>Unfortunately, we no longer use Solaris-based systems, and POSIX threads on 
Linux are preemptive.  So, the text below no longer applies, and is not required
reading for CS360.  However, I leave it here because it is still interesting, especially
for those of you studying user/system level threads in your Operating Systems class.</b></font>

<p>

The previous lecture notes talked a bit about preemption.  Here is some
more specific information about preemption in Solaris.  It is kind of
confusing, but once you understand all the details, you'll see that 
the Solaris thread system is very well designed.

</p><p>
There are two kinds of threads in Solaris: user-level threads, and 
system-level threads.  The distinction between the two is kind of 
confusing, but I'll try to enlighten you.  User-level threads 
exist solely in the running process -- they have no operating system
support.  That means that if a program has many user-level threads,
it looks the same to the operating system as a ``normal'' Unix program
with just one thread.  In Solaris, user-level threads are non-preemptive.
In other words, when a thread is running, it will not be interrupted by
another user-level thread unless it voluntarily blocks, through a 
call such as <b>pthread_exit()</b> or <b>pthread_join()</b>.
</p><p>
When one thread stops executing and another starts, we call that
a <i>thread context switch</i>.  To restate the above then, user
level threads only context switch when they voluntarily block.  If you
think about it, you can implement thread context switching with 
<b>setjmp()/longjmp()</b>.  What this means is that you don't need the
operating system in order to do thread context switching.  This in turn
means that context switching between user-level threads can be very 
fast, since there are no system calls involved.
</p><p>
So what is a system-level thread?  It is a unit of execution as seen
by the operating system.  Standard non-threaded Unix programs are each
managed by a separate system-level thread.  The operating system performs
<i>time-slicing</i> by periodically interrupting the system-level thread
that is currently running, saving its state, and running a different
system-level thread.  This is how you can have multiple programs running
simultaneously.  Such an action is also called <i>context switching</i>.
</p><p>
When you call <b>pthread_create()</b>, you create a 
new <i>user-level</i> thread that is managed by the same system-level
thread as the calling thread.  These two threads will execute non-preemptively
in relation to each other.  In fact, whenever a collection of user-level
threads is serviced by the same system-level thread, they all execute
non-preemptively in relation to each other.  All of the 
programs in the
<a href="http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~jplank/plank/classes/cs360/360/notes/Threads1/lecture.html">previous threads lecture</a> work
in this way.
</p><p>
Let's look at a few more.  First, look at 
<a href="http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~jplank/plank/classes/cs360/360/notes/Thread2/preempt1.c"><b>preempt1.c</b></a>.  
This is a program that forks off two threads, each of which runs
an infinite loop.  When you run it:
</p><pre>UNIX&gt; <font color="darkred"><b>preempt1</b></font>
thread 0.  i =          0
thread 0.  i =          1
thread 0.  i =          2
thread 0.  i =          3
thread 0.  i =          4
thread 0.  i =          5
...
</pre>
You'll see that only thread 0 runs.  (If you can't kill this with
control-c, go into another window and kill the process with the <b>kill</b>
command).  The reason that thread 1 never runs is that thread 0 never
voluntarily gives up the CPU.  This is called <i>starvation</i>.
<p>
Now, you can bind different user-level threads to different system-level
threads.  This means that if one user-level thread is running, then
at some point the operating system will interrupt it and run another
user-level thread.  This is because the two user-level threads are
bound to different system level threads.  
</p><p>
One way to bind a user-level thread to a different system level thread
is to call <b>pthread_create()</b> in a different way.  Look at
<a href="http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~jplank/plank/classes/cs360/360/notes/Thread2/preempt2.c"><b>preempt2.c</b></a>.    You'll see that you give
an ``attribute'' to <b>pthread_create()</b> that says ``create this
thread with a different system-level thread.''  Now when you run it, you'll
see that the two threads interleave -- every now and then, the running thread
is preempted, and the other thread gets to run:
</p><pre>UNIX&gt; <font color="darkred"><b>preempt2</b></font>
thread 0.  i =          0
thread 1.  i =          0
thread 0.  i =          1
thread 1.  i =          1
thread 1.  i =          2
thread 0.  i =          2
thread 0.  i =          3
thread 1.  i =          3
thread 0.  i =          4
thread 1.  i =          4
thread 0.  i =          5
thread 1.  i =          5
</pre>
Now, here's the tricky part of Solaris.  If a thread makes a blocking 
system call, then if there are other user-level threads bound to the
same system-level thread, a new system-level thread is created and 
the blocking thread is bound to it.  What this does is let the other
user-level threads run while the thread is blocked.  
<p>
This is a fundamental difference of Solaris and older operating
systems such as SunOS (the precursor to Solaris).  SunOS allows
only one system-level thread per process.  Therefore, if a user-level
thread makes a blocking system call in SunOS, all threads block until
the system call completes.  This is a drag.  The design in Solaris is
very nice.
</p><p>
So, look at 
<a href="http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~jplank/plank/classes/cs360/360/notes/Thread2/preempt3.c"><b>preempt3.c</b></a>.    First, you should see
that the threads are created as user-level threads bound to the 
same system-level thread.  Next, you'll see that the
thread 0 first reads a character from standard input
before beginning its loop.  This is a blocking system call.  Therefore,
it results this threads being bound to a separate system threads
from the main thread and thread 1.  Therefore, while it blocks, thread
1 can run.  Go ahead and run it:
</p><p>
</p><pre>UNIX&gt; <font color="darkred"><b>preempt3</b></font>
Thread 0: stopping to read
thread 1.  i =          0
thread 1.  i =          1
thread 1.  i =          2
thread 1.  i =          3
..
</pre>
So, thread 0 is blocked, and thread 1 is running.  They are thus
bound to separate system threads.  Now, type <b>RETURN</b>, and thread
0 will start up again, and you'll see that they interleave as in 
<b>preempt2</b>:
<pre>...
thread 1.  i =          3
                                <b>( RETURN was typed here )</b>
Thread 0: Starting up again
thread 0.  i =          0
thread 1.  i =          4
thread 0.  i =          1
thread 1.  i =          5
thread 0.  i =          2
thread 1.  i =          6
thread 0.  i =          3
...
</pre>

That's user/system level threads and preemption in a nutshell.  Go over these
examples again if you are confused.
