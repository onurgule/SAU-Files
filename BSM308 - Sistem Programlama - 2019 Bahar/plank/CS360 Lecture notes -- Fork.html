<h1>Getpid, getppid</h1>

A <i>process</i> is an executing 
instance of a program.  In Unix, you can make a listing of all the
processes that you are currently running with the <b>ps</b> command.  
Here's an example on my MacBook Pro in 2012:

<pre>UNIX&gt; <font color="darkred"><b>ps x</b></font>

If you try "ps x", you should see something like the above.  
The first column of
numbers are the "Process ID" numbers, which are called "pid"s.  Every 
process has a non-negative pid, which is unique to that process on that
machine while the process is executing.  There are two special processes
with pids 0 and 1: the scheduler and the <b>init</b> program (on my Mac, <b>init</b>
is called <b>launchd</b>).  You can see
them using <b>ps aux</b>:
(on some machines, you'll see the <b>init</b> process as "<b>/etc/init</b>", 
and the scheduler as "<b>sched</b>".  Also, some machines use different
options for <b>ps</b> -- if "<b>ps aux</b>" doesn't work, try 
"<b>ps -ef</b>").

UNIX&gt;
</pre>
These processes are always running while the machine is running.

<p>Every process has a "parent" process.  This is
the process that created it.  You can get your
pid and your parent's pid by using the <b>getpid()</b>
and <b>getppid()</b> commands.  The program 
<a href="http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~jplank/plank/classes/cs360/360/notes/Fork/showpid.c"><b>showpid.c</b></a>
is a simple program that prints out its pid, and its
parent's pid: 

</p><p></p><center><table border="3" cellpadding="3"><tbody><tr><td><pre>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;
#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;

int main()
{
  printf("My pid = %d.  My parent's pid = %d\n", getpid(), getppid());
  return 0;
}
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></center><p>

Each time you run it, it will show a different pid, but the same parent
pid:

</p><pre>UNIX&gt; <font color="darkred"><b>./showpid</b></font>
My pid = 854.  My parent's pid = 381
UNIX&gt; <font color="darkred"><b>./showpid</b></font>
My pid = 855.  My parent's pid = 381
UNIX&gt; <font color="darkred"><b>./showpid</b></font>
My pid = 856.  My parent's pid = 381
UNIX&gt; <font color="darkred"><b>./showpid</b></font>
My pid = 857.  My parent's pid = 381
UNIX&gt; <font color="darkred"><b>ps x</b></font>
...
  381 p2 S     0:01 -sh (csh)
...
UNIX&gt;
</pre>

As you can see, the <b>csh</b> is the parent of each of these.  This
is because you typed the commands into the <b>csh</b>, which then created
the <b>showpid</b> processes.

<hr>
<h1>Fork</h1>

<p>In Unix, all processes are created with the
system call <b>fork()</b>.  This is <i>without exception</i>.
What <b>fork()</b> does is the following:

</p><p>It creates a new process which is a copy of the
calling process.  That means that it copies the
caller's memory (code, globals, heap and stack),
registers, and open files.  The calling process
returns from <b>fork()</b> with the pid of the newly
created process (which is called the "child"
process.  The calling process is called the
"parent" process).  The newly created process, as
it is a duplicate of the parent, also returns
from the <b>fork()</b> call (this is because it is a
duplicate -- it has the same memory and
registers, and thus the same stack pointer, frame
pointer, and program counter, and thus has to
return from the <b>fork()</b> call).  It returns with a
value of zero.  This is how you know what process
you're in when <b>fork()</b> returns. 

</p><p>Look at 
<a href="http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~jplank/plank/classes/cs360/360/notes/Fork/simpfork.c"><b>simpfork.c</b></a>:

</p><p></p><center><table border="3" cellpadding="3"><tbody><tr><td><pre>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;

int main()
{
  int i;

  printf("simpfork: pid = %d\n", getpid());
  i = fork();
  printf("Did a fork.  It returned %d.  getpid = %d.  getppid = %d\n",
    i, getpid(), getppid());
  return 0;
}
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></center><p>


When it is executed, the following happens:

</p><pre>UNIX&gt; <font color="darkred"><b>./simpfork</b></font>
simpfork: pid = 914
Did a fork.  It returned 915.  getpid = 914.  getppid = 381
Did a fork.  It returned 0.  getpid = 915.  getppid = 914
UNIX&gt;
</pre>

<p>So, what is going on?  When <b>simpfork</b> is executed,
it has a pid of 914.  Next it calls <b>fork()</b>
creating a duplicate process with a pid of 915.
The parent gains control of the CPU, and returns
from <b>fork()</b> with a return value of the 915 --
this is the child's pid.  It prints out this
return value, its own pid, and the pid of <b>csh</b>,
which is still 381.  Then it exits.  Next, the child gets the CPU
and returns from <b>fork()</b> with a value of 0.  It
prints out that value, its pid, and the pid of
the parent. 

</p><p>Note, there is no guarantee which process gains
control of the CPU first after a <b>fork()</b>.  It
could be the parent, and it could be the child.
When I executed <b>simpfork</b> a second time, the child
got control first:

</p><pre>UNIX&gt; <font color="darkred"><b>./simpfork </b></font>
simpfork: pid = 928
Did a fork.  It returned 0.  getpid = 929.  getppid = 928
Did a fork.  It returned 929.  getpid = 928.  getppid = 381
UNIX&gt;
</pre>

(On some machines, it does appear that the child always gets control
first, but you should not rely on such a fact when writing code).

<hr>

Now, look at <a href="http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~jplank/plank/classes/cs360/360/notes/Fork/simpfork2.c"><b>simpfork2.c</b></a>.  It calls
<b>fork()</b>, and has the parent exit immediately.  The child calls
<b>sleep(5)</b>, which makes it sleep for 5 seconds, and then it prints out
its pid, and its parent's pid.  What is subtle about this?  Well, by
the time the child wakes up from sleeping, the parent has exited,
and its process is no longer.  Thus, <b>getppid()</b> can't return the old
value of the parent's pid, as that pid is no longer valid.  What Unix
does in these cases is transfer the parentage of the child's program.
Specifically, when the parent of a program exits, the <b>init</b> program
(pid 1) becomes its parent.  Thus, when the child prints out its
parent after sleeping, it prints out pid 1: 

<pre>UNIX&gt; <font color="darkred"><b>./simpfork2</b></font>
Child.  getpid() = 1301, getppid() = 1300
Parent exiting now
UNIX&gt; <font color="darkred"><b>After sleeping.  getpid() = 1301, getppid() = 1</b></font>
</pre>

Note that the <b>"UNIX&gt;"</b> prompt returns once the parent returns, even
though the child is still running.  This is because <b>csh</b> waits only for
the parent to complete, not for any other processes.  
<p>
The name for a child process whose parent has exited is an <i>orphan</i>.  Sometimes
you'll hear that "orphans are inherited by <b>init</b>."  That means that when a process'
parent exits, <b>init</b> becomes its new parent.


</p><hr>

<a href="http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~jplank/plank/classes/cs360/360/notes/Fork/simpfork3.c"><b>Simpfork3.c</b></a>
is a simple program to show that the parent's
address space is indeed copied to the child
during the fork.  After the fork, each process
has memory locations for <b>j</b> (a local variable) and <b>K</b> (a global
variable).  Thus, when the
child changes <b>j</b> to 201 and <b>K</b> to 301, it only
affects its values of <b>j</b> and <b>K</b>, and not the
parent's: 

<pre>UNIX&gt; <font color="darkred"><b>./simpfork3</b></font>
Before forking: j (Address 0x7ffc767e88b8) = 200.   K (Address 0x601048) = 300
Child after:    j (Address 0x7ffc767e88b8) = 201.   K (Address 0x601048) = 301
Parent after:   j (Address 0x7ffc767e88b8) = 200.   K (Address 0x601048) = 300
UNIX&gt; <font color="darkred"><b></b></font>
</pre>

You'll note that <b>j</b> and <b>K</b> have the same addresses in the parent
and the child.  But these are <i>different</i> memory locations on the machine, because
the operating system and hardware cooperate so that addresses that are relative
to a process are translated at runtime to other addresses on the machine.  That
is why the two processes have the same addresses, but different memory locations
and different values.

Interestingly, if we redirect the output of <b>./simpfork3</b> to a file, we
see the following behavior:

<pre>UNIX&gt; <font color="darkred"><b>./simpfork3 &gt; output.txt</b></font>
UNIX&gt; <font color="darkred"><b>cat output.txt</b></font>
Before forking: j (Address 0x7ffdb989bd88) = 200.   K (Address 0x601048) = 300
Child after:    j (Address 0x7ffdb989bd88) = 201.   K (Address 0x601048) = 301
Before forking: j (Address 0x7ffdb989bd88) = 200.   K (Address 0x601048) = 300
Parent after:   j (Address 0x7ffdb989bd88) = 200.   K (Address 0x601048) = 300
UNIX&gt; <font color="darkred"><b></b></font>
</pre>

When redirecting output to a terminal,
<b>stdout</b> is buffered line by line -- that is, once
you do a <b>putchar('\n')</b> or equivalent, the buffer
is written to standard output with a "<b>write(1,
...)</b>".  However, when <b>stdout</b> is redirected to a
file (or a pipe), the stdio library buffers on a coarser
scale -- not writing until some large buffer
(probably 4K or 8K characters) is full.  Thus, at
the time of the <b>fork()</b> call, the "<b>Before forking:</b>"
string has not been written to <b>fd</b>=1.  Instead,
it has been buffered in the standard I/O library.
That buffer is part of <b>simpfork3</b>'s address space,
and is thus <i>copied</i> to the child process when
<b>fork()</b> is called.  Thus, when the bytes are
finally flushed from the buffer, the "<b>Before
forking: ...</b>" string is written to the file
twice.  This is an important thing to realize.
It looks strange, but has a logical explanation.  Remember
this, because if you try to debug and are getting weird
duplicate output, the reason may be because the standard I/O
buffer is not getting flushed.
<p>
The same thing happens when you redirect through a pipe:

</p><pre>UNIX&gt; <font color="darkred"><b>./simpfork3 | cat</b></font>
Before forking: j (Address 0x7ffc19ab1738) = 200.   K (Address 0x601048) = 300
Child after:    j (Address 0x7ffc19ab1738) = 201.   K (Address 0x601048) = 301
Before forking: j (Address 0x7ffc19ab1738) = 200.   K (Address 0x601048) = 300
Parent after:   j (Address 0x7ffc19ab1738) = 200.   K (Address 0x601048) = 300
UNIX&gt; <font color="darkred"><b></b></font>
</pre>


<p>
To fix this, call <b>fflush(stdout)</b> before calling <b>fork()</b>.
That makes the standard I/O library do the appropriate <b>write()</b>
call, flushing the buffer, and now an empty buffer gets copied to the child process.
</p><hr>

<a href="http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~jplank/plank/classes/cs360/360/notes/Fork/simpfork4.c"><b>Simpfork4.c</b></a>
shows how open files are shared across <b>fork()</b> calls.

<p></p><center><table border="3" cellpadding="3"><tbody><tr><td><pre>int main()
{
  int i;
  int seekp;
  int fd;
  char *s1;
  char s2[1000];

  <font color="blue">/* Open a file for writing, and then call fork(). */</font>

  fd = open("tmpfile.txt", O_WRONLY | O_TRUNC | O_CREAT, 0666);

  s1 = "Before forking\n";
  write(fd, s1, strlen(s1));

  i = fork();

  <font color="blue">/* Delay the parent by a second, so that the child runs first. */</font>

  if (i &gt; 0) {
    sleep(1);  
    s1 = "Parent";
  } else {
    s1 = "Child";
  }

  <font color="blue">/* Print the file's seek pointer. 
     Do a write, and print the seek pointer again. */</font>

  seekp = lseek(fd, 0, SEEK_CUR);
  printf("%s: After forking, before writing: Seek pointer = %d\n", s1, seekp);

  sprintf(s2, "%s: After forking.\n", s1);
  write(fd, s2, strlen(s2));

  seekp = lseek(fd, 0, SEEK_CUR);
  printf("%s: After forking, after  writing: Seek pointer = %d\n", s1, seekp);

  return 0;
}
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></center><p>

Specifically, all open file descriptors are duplicated.  Thus, the
file opened for writing in <b>simpfork4.c</b> is open in both the 
parent and
child processes.  Note that the open file is the same -- when one
writes to the end of the file, the seek pointer is changed in both
the parent and the child.  This is because both processes point to
the same open file structure in the operating system.  If the two did
not share the same open file pointer, then the parent's write would
overwrite the child's write.  

</p><pre>UNIX&gt; <font color="darkred"><b>./simpfork4</b></font>
Child: After forking, before writing: Seek pointer = 15
Child: After forking, after  writing: Seek pointer = 37

Parent: After forking, after  writing: Seek pointer = 60

<p>I will go over more on sharing file descriptors in the <b>dup</b> lecture.
</p><hr>
<h3>Fork Bombs</h3>

A fork bomb is a loop of <b>fork()</b> calls that has gone out of control.  It
is hard to deal with, because when you make too many <b>fork()</b> calls, the operating
system will make subsequent <b>fork()</b> calls fail, and then your shell cannot call
<b>fork()</b> to launch a program to kill the rogue processes.
<p>
To give you a little practice, try these two programs.  First, 
look at 
<b><a href="http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~jplank/plank/classes/cs360/360/notes/Fork/forkbomb1.c">forkbomb1.c</a></b>

</p><p></p><center><table border="3" cellpadding="3"><tbody><tr><td><pre>int main()
{
  int i;
  int fv;

  for (i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++) {
    fv = fork();
    printf("Process: %8d -- i = %d\n", getpid(), i);
    if (fv == 0) exit(0);
  }
  return 0;
} 
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></center><p>
</p><p>

This isn't a fork-bomb -- it just shows one process creating 10 processes.
If I asked you on a test how many lines of output this program produces, your
answer should be 20 -- 10 for the process calling <b>fork()</b>, and one for
each of the ten child processes:

</p><pre>UNIX&gt; <font color="darkred"><b>./forkbomb1</b></font>
Process:    60731 -- i = 0
Process:    60731 -- i = 1
Process:    60731 -- i = 2
Process:    60733 -- i = 1
Process:    60731 -- i = 3
Process:    60732 -- i = 0
Process:    60731 -- i = 4
Process:    60731 -- i = 5
Process:    60731 -- i = 6
Process:    60734 -- i = 2
Process:    60731 -- i = 7
Process:    60735 -- i = 3
Process:    60731 -- i = 8
Process:    60731 -- i = 9
Process:    60737 -- i = 5
Process:    60736 -- i = 4
Process:    60738 -- i = 6
Process:    60740 -- i = 8
Process:    60739 -- i = 7
Process:    60741 -- i = 9
UNIX&gt; <font color="darkred"><b></b></font>
</pre>

There are some interesting features of the output -- the operating system schedules processes,
so sometimes the main process executes for a few iterations before the children get to (e.g.
the first three lines).  Moreover, once multiple children have been created, they can be
executed in any order.  For example, process 60740 (i=8) executes before process 60739 (i=7), even
though process 60739 was created first.

<p>
The true fork bomb is in
<b><a href="http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~jplank/plank/classes/cs360/360/notes/Fork/forkbomb2.c">forkbomb2.c</a></b>:

</p><p></p><center><table border="3" cellpadding="3"><tbody><tr><td><pre>int main()
{
  int i;
  int fv;

  for (i = 0; i &lt; 4; i++) {
    fv = fork();
    printf("Process: %8d -- i = %d\n", getpid(), i);
    fflush(stdout);
  }
} 
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></center><p>

On the first iteration, the parent calls <b>fork()</b>, so there are two processes
printing out i=0.  Now each of those two processes iterates and call <b>fork()</b>,
so there are four processes with i=1.  Similarly, there are 8 processes with i=2 and
16 with i=3.  Exponential blow-up.  These kinds of programs can happen (see the next
lecture), so be aware of them.  If you iterate too many times, the operating system
will start denying the <b>fork()</b> calls, and you are in trouble......
